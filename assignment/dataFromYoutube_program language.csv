Correction: The first date for the algorithm of the analytical machine should be closer to the mid 1830's, not 1883; as both Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were no longer around during that year. The source I was referring to was incorrect.

As someone famous once said somewhere; to know where you are going, you have to know where you have been. Therefore, whether you're studying computer science in college, you're a programming language enthusiast or a history buff; the brief history of programming languages will satisfy your unquenchable thirst for knowledge (maybe).

Computer programming languages have evolved greatly over time (as well as the computer itself). From Fortran to Python and Basic to Swift, programming languages have added and taken away features for decades. Throughout this video, I give a brief summary of a majority of the most influential programming languages over the decades.

Do you remember that beautiful black Unix box called ""Next""?\n\nAlso, it\'s missing some real landmarks such as Prolog, and functional languages are not reserved to math & science.

Lisp has evolved into Scheme, which is also beautiful once you figure how it ""thinks"",\n\nSQL is a query language, not a programming language, PL-SQL is, as well as Borland\'s QBE (which was genius at the time) that was coming with Paradox. The language coming with IBM\'s DB2 was a programming language, from the ground up. In the same range, interacting with dBase, there was ""Nantucket Clipper"", that was pretty much everywhere in the late 80s-early 90s.\n\nYou mentioned several times Visual Basic but missed PowerShell,  Although it\'s a terrible language (slow, cumbersome and counterintuitive), it\'s very widespread, due to its integration in Windows. However, it\'s mostly used as a side for quick & dirty work and rarely in commercial products, hence it\'s not too easy to evaluate its actual usage. What I know is that you need to do PowerShell if you want to automate interaction with VMware environment.\n\nAnd there was Delphi, as major for Pascal as C++ for C. Turbo Pascal was already OO since v5.5, was running under Windows since Turbo Pascal 7.0, but Delphi added database connectivity, RAD and Client-Server paradigms, which was a major development of the language.', ""Python may be more readable than more esoteric ones predating it, but its use of whitespace to define blocks is hideous.

Let me clarify a few things:\n\n1. The point here was not to say that some languages have no use cases. It was just meant to be fun and discuss languages I do/don\'t enjoy using and their overall impact on the industry. Use whatever you want to use or whatever works for your needs - I use many of the languages I ranked lower in this list frequently.\n\n2. I never said I don\'t understand Python or that it was garbage. I use Python professionally basically every day, and I ranked it fairly highly. I just focused on the negatives as many of the positives are a given. The point is to share my deviations from the standard take. \n\n3. My ""problem"" with Python and why I didn\'t rank it higher is that it consistently breaks conventions. It might even make better choices than languages before it, but imo it deviates too much from syntactical norms. This makes it a pain in large dev teams as people who don\'t work in Python every day have to look at loops with code like enumerate(range(whatever)) and try to convert that to traditional loops in their head. Or they have to look at list comprehension messes that oftentimes prioritize conciseness over readability. The increment operator was just one tiny example of this, but there are many more. Also I personally am just not a huge fan of the whitespace sensitivity over curly braces, but that\'s mostly personal preference. \n\n4. Yes I am aware TS exists, and when I say JS I am more of referring to both of them. This might heat some frontend devs, but TS is a syntax extension of JS, it\'s closer to a framework than its own language.\n\n5. Some reasoning behind JavaScript in GOAT: It can easily be used on the frontend and backend, and it has the most developers who know it. This gives it more versatility than arguably any other language, and it helps prevent context switching. It\'s an incredibly efficient way to work for full-stack developers. There are more jobs using JavaScript than any other language. The open source ecosystem/community is larger than any other. Despite what random comments will tell you, it\'s generally pretty performant in the modern day. This is less an artifact of the language itself and more the deep level of effort put into implementations of it, but still worth stating. Also, I just enjoy the syntax personally, but at the end of the day that\'s just a personal preference.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk, carry on with your intended JS flame. Just be kind to each other please ü§ù', ""Why do you rate Java Script when it's not even a strongly typed language?"", 'JS GOAT? nah', ""Isn't Python an EASIER version of Java? lmao."", 'Thanks for this straight to the point explanation']"

This is less flexible than C/C++ where they can be declared obsolutely anywhere, but IMO declaring variables anywhere can also be a bad practice. What is really annoying is to not be able to declare the loop index right in the loop construct (DO INTEGER::i  =1, N is not possible, although it\'s possible in the more recent DO CONCURRENT construct)', 'This is what we do still to this day.

7SKVQyA4TjU,Learn Any Programming Language In 3 Hours!,"How do you go about learning a new programming language ‚Äì Fast?
In this lesson, I‚Äôll the way I learn new languages so that I can go from no knowledge at all to writing moderately complicated programs in about three hours.

Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean I can learn everything about that language in just three hours. But it does make it possible for me to get to grips with most of the essentials ‚Äì data types, variables, string-handling, classes, methods, modules and so on ‚Äì in a really fast and effective way.

This lesson assumes that you already have experience with at least one programming language. This is not the way a complete beginner would approach learning to program. But if you know any programming language at all you will understand numerous concepts such as variables, data types, functions and loops. And using that knowledge, you will then be able to learn a new language by doing hands-on coding as I explain in this video.
In this tutorial I use the D language, DLang (mainly because I haven‚Äôt programmed in D before so I can show you exactly how I spent my first three hours with the language. But I would follow the same steps, more or less, with any language. That is how I began with C, C#, Java, Ruby and all the other languages which I use when programming. 

This approach can be simplified to four steps:
1. Pick a Programming Project
2. Try to guess how to do simple programming operations.
3. Only when you run into problems, refer to the documentation.
4. Use the Debugger!

ifo76VyrBYo,Introduction to Computer Programming | What is it? Programming Language Types,"in this tutorial you will learn the concept of computer programming and the types of programming languages available including the machine level assembly, higher and middle level languages with their advantages and disadvantages.

Quick Access to Topics
0:00 : Introduction to Computer Programming and Who is a Programmer
3:51 : Types of Programming Languages Explained
12:59 : Compilation and Interpretation Methods Explained

A computer is a general purpose machines which can perform many computational task and the modern day computers that we have they can perform billions or trillions of calculations within a fraction of second. 
These computer's they can't really do anything on their own. so for a computer to do something one has to give the instructions to it and these instructions will contain step by step information to perform a specific task and these are called as program.

The person who is going to write these instructions or the program is called as the programmer and here the programmer will write the program and the computer will execute that or computer will work on that instructions

The language in which the instructions are written or the language in which this program is written is called as the programming language. now there are several types of programming languages available.

Computers are built to understand the binary language / machine language and since it is difficult to code, assembly languages are invented.
After that middle and higher level languages were invented.

program written in middle / higher language are converted to machine code and executed in either through the compilation method or by using the interpretation method.

languages which use compilation method are called as compiled languages.
for example c, c++ etc.

languages which use interpretation method are called as interpreted languages.
for example python

you will also learn about the terms like program programming programmer compiler and interpreter, compilation and interpretation.

About C:- 
¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞
The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices.C is the most widely used computer language. 

Why To Learn C Programming
¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞
C programming¬†language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:

 Easy to learn
 Structured language
 It produces efficient programs
 It can handle low-level activities
 It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

Fact About C
¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞

 C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.

 C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.

 The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).

 The UNIX OS was totally written in C.

 Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.

 Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.

printf() and scanf() in C
¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞
The printf() and scanf() functions are used for input and output in C language. Both functions are inbuilt library functions, defined in stdio.h (header file).

printf() function
¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞
The¬†printf() function¬†is used for output. It prints the given statement to the console.

The syntax of printf() function is given below:

printf(""format¬†string"",argument_list);¬†¬†

The¬†format string¬†can be %d (integer), %c (character), %s (string), %f (float) etc.

scanf() function
¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞¬∞
The¬†scanf() function¬†is used for input. It reads the input data from the console.

scanf(""format¬†string"",argument_list);¬†¬†

The beauty of it was that about  90 percent of Unix was written in C , the other 10 percent had to be written in assembly code because it  dealt with the hardware drivers. C was an in-house language for some time and we at DEC could not get our hands on it even though they were using DEC computers to develop it. This was at Bell Labs Whippany in New Jersey. I met Thompson , father-john jeans and all, when he asked me about the purpose of a jumper on one of the pdp11 computers.  Eventually C got out to the public through the educational system.  Bell Labs, as a monopoly, were under strict rules as to what they could sell, and was eventually broken up into 'Baby Bells'. The plethora of C languages that came after that is legion. It took a long time for the final product to settle down."", ""He answered a question I've always wanted answered: Did they write the C programming language and its compiler in C itself?

‚úÖ What makes Python the best programming language for AI in 2024?
Python is considered the best programming language for AI in 2024 due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and active community support. Its libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn make it easier to implement complex algorithms and work with large datasets. Additionally, Python's readability and flexibility make it a favorite among developers working on AI projects, enabling rapid prototyping and development.

‚úÖ Why is choosing the right programming language important for AI development?
Choosing the right programming language is crucial for AI development because it impacts the efficiency and scalability of your projects. The right language should offer powerful tools, libraries, and frameworks that simplify AI tasks like data processing, machine learning, and natural language processing. Python, for instance, excels in these areas, making it the preferred choice for AI and ensuring that your projects are built on a solid, efficient foundation.",2024-08-24T13:00:55Z,UCCktnahuRFYIBtNnKT5IYyg,Intellipaat,"['Best Programming Language For AI', 'AI', 'Python', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'TensorFlow', 'PyTorch', 'AI Development', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Data Science', 'Tech Trends', 'Programming', 'AI Projects', 'Python For AI', 'Python with AI', 'AI Tools in coding', 'AI in programming', 'Coding with AI', 'Shorts Video', 'Shorts Feed', 'Shorts Feed Video', 'Shorts Feed Viral', 'Intellipaat']",27,en,PT13S,202910,5509,0,38,"['Python is father of ai', 'AI is not a programming tool or language pal', 'Tensorflow, Numpy and other python libraries made using C++ are laughing in cornerüòÇ', 'linux angrily looking at AI', 'C++>>>>>.. python']"

So we ended last episode with programming at the hardware level with things like plugboards and huge panels of switches, but what was really needed was a more versatile way to program computers - software! For much of this series we‚Äôve been talking about machine code, or the 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs our computers read to perform operations, but giving our computers instructions in 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs is incredibly inefficient, and a ‚Äúhigher-level‚Äù language was needed. This led to the development of assembly code and assemblers that allow us to use operands and mnemonics to more easily write programs, but assembly language is still tied to underlying hardware. So by 1952 Navy officer Grace Hopper had helped created the first high-level programming language A-0 and compiler to translate that code to our machines. This would eventually lead to IBM‚Äôs Fortran and then a golden age of computing languages over the coming decades. Most importantly, these new languages utilized new abstractions to make programming easier and more powerful giving more and more people the ability to create new and amazing things.

iey1AikkgKw,Top 5 Easiest Programming Languages To Learn,"These are the top 5 easiest programming languages to learn in my opinion - Swift, Go, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python.

Swift has a super simple syntax developed by Apple for iOS/MacOS/etc. However, it can be difficult due to the need to work with XCode.

Go is a great choice developed by Google for creating performant backends without the need for a more traditionally difficult language like C++.

Ruby has a very simple language made for ""developer happiness"". That said, the use cases have been shrinking over the years.

JavaScript is the primary language of the frontend of the internet, plus it can be used on the backend with Node or even for mobile with tools like React Native. It has the largest ecosystem of any language, meaning there are tons of amazing tools out there to make it easier to learn.

Python is considered by many to be the easiest mainstream programming language to learn. The syntax is super simple, it has a huge ecosystem, and there are tons of use cases from web backends to data science and machine learning.

‚úÖ What are the key differences between Python and R?
Python and R are both powerful languages for data analysis, but they serve different purposes. Python is known for its versatility and is widely used for general-purpose programming, web development, and machine learning. R, on the other hand, is specifically designed for statistical analysis and data visualization, making it a favorite among statisticians and data scientists. The choice between Python and R often depends on the specific needs of a project.

‚úÖ Which language should I choose for data science: Python or R?
The choice between Python and R for data science depends on your project requirements and personal preference. Python is more versatile, with a wide range of libraries for machine learning, web development, and automation. R excels in statistical analysis and visualization, making it ideal for tasks that require in-depth data exploration. Many data scientists start with Python due to its broader applicability but may switch to R for specific statistical tasks.",2024-09-02T14:03:00Z,UCCktnahuRFYIBtNnKT5IYyg,Intellipaat,"['Python Vs R', 'Python Vs R Programming Language', 'R vs Python', 'R for Data Analysis', 'Python for Data Analysis', 'R for Data Science', 'Python for Data Science', 'Programming Language for Data Science', 'R vs Python Machine Learning', 'R vs Python Data Science', 'R vs Python Comparison', 'Programming Short Video', 'Coding Short Video', 'Top Coding Languages 2024', 'Learn Coding', 'Tech Shorts', 'Shorts Video', 'Shorts Feed', 'Intellipaat']",27,en,PT38S,129777,1632,0,13,"['Python Pandas vs R Software', 'So what you are trying to convince here?', 'R?', 'Now I have another reason for me to love python ü§£', 'Python will lose to java and C#']"

With graphics again if you prefer Rust and just want to do graphics as a hobby then go for it but if you want a job in the industry or you have no experience in C or C++ which is what most resources will be in its probably a good idea not to go with Rust or at least get your feet wet with C/C++.\n\nBasically, just pick whatevers best for your use case and pick something you enjoy programming in.""]"

When you have bored programmers with a lot of free time, things like esolangs tend to arise. Esoteric programming languages are strange and fascinating, and I discussed ten of them in this video. I chose the ones that I thought were the most interesting and would garner the most attention. I hope you find this video interesting and, most importantly, entertaining. If you could share and like this video, that would help me tremendously. Let me know what you liked and disliked in the video so I can create better content for you (I won't stop swearing, the least I could do is bleep them out, and if I don't, it's because it sounded too funny).

Many people use the terms ""programming"" and ""coding"" interchangeably, but there‚Äôs a subtle difference between them. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:

Coding üñäÔ∏è

Definition: The act of writing code in a specific programming language like Python, Java, or C++.
Focus: Translating logic into a language the computer understands, often following predefined rules or instructions.
Example: Writing functions, loops, and conditionals.
Programming üß†

Definition: The broader process that involves planning, designing, testing, and maintaining the code to solve complex problems or build complete software applications.
Focus: Involves not only coding but also thinking about algorithms, data structures, debugging, and optimizing solutions.
Example: Building an entire software system, from concept to deployment.

LxciRHJaGXY,Why C# is the Coolest Programming Language Ever? üòé | C++ | Microsoft |  Anders Hejlsberg | #shorts,"Did you know that the name ""C#"" was inspired by musical notation? The ""#"" symbol, known as a sharp, indicates a note that is raised by one semitone. Check out how this programming language came to be. 

What is C#?
C# (pronounced ""C sharp"") is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft. It is part of the Microsoft .NET framework and is primarily used for building a wide range of applications, including desktop software, web applications, mobile apps, and games.

What is software engineering?
It‚Äôs a branch of computer science that focuses on designing and developing computer systems and application software.
Software engineers are experts in programming languages, software development, and operating systems and use engineering principles to create software.

What is computer science?
Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It encompasses the design, development, and analysis of algorithms, programming languages, software, and hardware. Computer scientists solve complex problems, create new technologies, and drive innovation in fields such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and robotics.

What is the tech industry?
The tech industry refers to the businesses and organisations involved in the development, design, manufacturing, and distribution of technology products and services, including computer hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and e-commerce services. It is a rapidly growing and constantly evolving sector with a significant impact on the global economy.

Future of programming
Programming is a job that requires abstract thinking, logical thinking, and attention to detail. You want to retrain yourself on skills that align with your interests and passions. In the age of emerging technology: artificial intelligence, big data, virtual reality, and robotics, there are plenty of jobs that will require technical understanding but at the same time involve more human skills. These jobs won‚Äôt be replaced by technology any time soon. Coding won‚Äôt just be relevant in the coming ten years, it will be more relevant than it is now.

What is a programming language?
A programming language is a type of computer language that programmers use to create software applications, scripts, or other collections of instructions that are executed by computers. Today, hundreds of programming languages are in use. Some are immensely popular, while others have fallen out of favour.

k9WqpQp8VSU,How I Would Learn To Code (If I Could Start Over),"If I could go back in time and learn to code, I would do a lot of things differently. If I could start over, I'd spend more time doing practical projects rather than focusing on theory. I would also prioritize learning how to use an editor and the terminal. And above all, I'd adopt a coding mindset. Today, I walk you through an entire study plan to become a coder/software engineer. I hope this guide inspires you to keep coding and continue your software engineering career. 

I'm a 23 year old, recent graduate working at a high growth startup! Follow along for insights into the tech industry, all things startup, and what to expect as a recent-grad remote software engineer.

q1ZmFc-sqNc,the TRUTH about C++ (is it worth your time?),"C++ gets a lot of hate on the internet, and there may be good reason for that. I think C++ is misunderstood, and there are a few simple reasons why. Despite being designed around 3 simple principles, the language has inflated to have a ton of features that are either too complicated to understand, or too powerful to implement without making your code base unmanageable. 

But, should you learn C++? Yes. There are a few caveats though.

NIyzh-Lshrk,the TRUTH about what programming language you should learn FIRST,"It feels like every day there are more and more programming languages coming out. And while resources like YouTube and online courses exist, its really hard for new programmers to choose what language they should learn first when learning how to program. 

In this video, I'll suggest my two languages to learn how to program, and one method that I suggest to everyone to make sure they don't get discouraged along the way.

When you have bored programmers with a lot of free time, things like esolangs tend to arise. Esoteric programming languages are strange and fascinating, and I discussed ten of them in this video. I chose the ones that I thought were the most interesting and would garner the most attention. I hope you find this video interesting and, most importantly, entertaining. If you could share and like this video, that would help me tremendously. Let me know what you liked and disliked in the video so I can create better content for you (I won't stop swearing, the least I could do is bleep them out, and if I don't, it's because it sounded too funny).

o4F3G5g5H-Y,How Much A Python Developer Earn ? | Python Developer Salary In India #Shorts #simplilearn,"In this video on How Much A Python Developer Earn ?, we'll dive into the world of Python development and explore the earning potential for Python developers. Python development involves writing and maintaining code in the Python programming language to create software applications, scripts, and tools. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it popular for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Python developers work on a wide range of projects, from building websites and APIs to analyzing data and developing machine learning models.

The average salary for an entry-level Python developer in India is around 5-8 lakhs per annum (lpa). However, with experience and specialization, the earning potential significantly increases. In my network, I know people who have been in the field for a little over five years and earn as high as 15-20 lpa. The key to achieving higher earnings lies in gaining experience, continuously updating your skills, and staying abreast of the latest industry trends.

We'll also discuss various factors that can influence a Python developer's salary, such as location, industry, and level of expertise. Additionally, we'll provide tips on how to boost your earning potential, including the importance of certifications, networking, and taking on challenging projects.

9WQgAwkuPx4,How many programming languages needed for Placement/Internship in Top Companies  #placement #coding,"Many students feel overwhelmed by the pressure to learn multiple languages, but the truth is that depth matters more than breadth. 
When you focus on one language, you can dive deep into its nuances, build a strong foundation, and become proficient in problem-solving and coding techniques. 
Top companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are more interested in your ability to write clean, efficient code and solve complex problems rather than the number of languages you know.

For example, software development roles often prioritize languages like C++, Java, or Python, while web development might require proficiency in JavaScript, along with frameworks like React.js, or Python for back-end development. For data science and AI, Python or R are essential.

In addition to your core language, having a basic understanding of a secondary language or technology, such as SQL for database management or Bash for scripting, can enhance your versatility. Familiarity with popular frameworks and libraries associated with your main language also strengthens your profile.

k9WqpQp8VSU,How I Would Learn To Code (If I Could Start Over),"If I could go back in time and learn to code, I would do a lot of things differently. If I could start over, I'd spend more time doing practical projects rather than focusing on theory. I would also prioritize learning how to use an editor and the terminal. And above all, I'd adopt a coding mindset. Today, I walk you through an entire study plan to become a coder/software engineer. I hope this guide inspires you to keep coding and continue your software engineering career. 

I'm a 23 year old, recent graduate working at a high growth startup! Follow along for insights into the tech industry, all things startup, and what to expect as a recent-grad remote software engineer.

gkyOHjM6GQA,Best Programming Language for Mobile App Development,"If you have a great idea for an app, you may be wondering what‚Äôs the best programming language to develop your app in.

Can you use any language for Android and iOS app development, or is there a ‚Äúbest‚Äù language?

When it comes to mobile app development, there isn‚Äôt really one single ‚Äúbest‚Äù programming language, and it really depends on what kind of app you‚Äôre making.

Here‚Äôs what you need to remember:

The programming language should be practical. It should give you ample control over your project without needing too many external resources.

It should be popular. Choosing a language that‚Äôs popular is important because popularity means you‚Äôll have a large community behind it, a wealth of tools, frameworks, and resources to use. 

And finally, the language you choose should be prosperous. It shouldn‚Äôt just be the language of the hour, but rather one that‚Äôs foreseen to be used many years down the road.

Every programming language has its pros and cons, and not a single one is perfect.

Picking the right one is all about what kind of app you‚Äôre trying to build and for what platform.

Knowing these details first will help you narrow down your list so you can make the best choice for your specific app project.

In this video, we‚Äôll go into detail about which language is best to get started in creating your own mobile app and how you can make the right choice for your project.

ViPNHMSUcog,Programming with Math | The Lambda Calculus,"The Lambda Calculus is a tiny mathematical programming language that has the same computational power as any language you can dream of. In this video, we'll first explore this calculus before seeing how we can flesh it out into a functional programming language.

After a brief tour of a simple type system, we'll see why the Lambda Calculus has some surprising applications in the field of mathematical logic, and how the implications of this relationship could alter the way that we study mathematics forever.

There are so many programming languages that are used on a daily basis. 
With Python, Java, and C++ being the most popular programming languages right now, are they going to be just as useful in the future?

Here‚Äôs Saumya Singh (Associate Software Engineer, Red Hat) talking about the programming languages that will be used extensively in the future. Must watch!

What is a programming language?

Programmers create software programmes, scripts, and other sets of instructions for computers to follow using a programming language.

Brian Kernighan is a professor of computer science at Princeton University. He co-authored the C Programming Language with Dennis Ritchie (creator of C) and has written a lot of books on programming, computers, and life including the Practice of Programming, the Go Programming Language, his latest UNIX: A History and a Memoir. He co-created AWK, the text processing language used by Linux folks like myself. He co-designed AMPL, an algebraic modeling language for large-scale optimization.

This was on the same computer as Sketchpad, the MIT TX-2. There\'s a demo video of it on YouTube called ""Programming with On-Line Graphics"".\n* Scratch was actually inspired by another block-based programming language, LogoBlocks, developed at MIT in 1995 to control Lego robots, which were eventually sold as the first Lego robotics kit, the RCX, in 1998.

vyR6Qg5B6Z0,How To Learn Any Programming Language Fast,"About a year ago I got really interested in React and wanted to learn it well. I could follow along with tutorials and build simple apps but didn't understand the fundamental underlying concepts well. 

With a combination of common programming knowledge and Stack Overflow, I could build most things. But I couldn't explain what was going on under the hood. I wanted to go deeper into the language. 

In this video, I'll share personally an approach I took, then, that really catapulted me ahead in my understanding of React. 

If you are looking to go deeper into a programming language or framework or are looking to learn a new one fast, I think this tactic will help you greatly.

I say that it aims to automatically distinguish between cases where something needs to be deallocated at the end of the scope it was defined in, and cases where runtime reference counting is needed. But I skirted over one of its core value props - and that is that it aims to determine at compile time when memory is no longer needed and deallocate that memory, even when that place is not in the same scope where the memory was allocated. The claim is that it can do this *without* a runtime reference count in the vast majority of scenarios, but will fall back to runtime reference counting in the cases where it can't."", 'jai is better.\nthough it is currently in private beta', ""Yeah, V is a great language but unfortunately has the most bizarrely toxic community I've ever seen for a programming language.

And again, V itself is a fantastic language... but man, they got more toxic members in their community then any other language I've seen to date. It's all so weird and off-putting.

_j4Lj-BT00g,PROGRAMMING for kids üë¶ Basic concepts üíª Part 1,"In this educational video, children will learn what programming is in a very simple way. Programming is the language of technology and machines. It was created by humans in order to make machines understand us and do what we want. Programming has different languages, which means that it has different ways of giving orders to the machines. Through these languages we can write code, combining words and symbols, which form commands. Commands are the orders we give to machines. They tell them what actions to perform. Algorithms are a sequence of detailed step-by-step instructions. In programming, algorithms are written by programmers for a machine to perform its task.

This video is a very useful and interesting resource for children to learn how to code. It is an excellent video for primary education.

I left it out because I couldn\'t figure out how to cover it well. It makes a brief cameo at 0:59 (lower-left), and I say a bit about it at the companion site: https://hillelwayne.com/talks/esolangs/#diversity\n\n> Is Game of Life an esolang?\n\nGoL is a special case of a **cellular automata**, which has been the model for several esolangs (https://esolangs.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). GoL is Turing complete, but it\'s not really a *language*. It\'s more of a language substrate. You can use GoL to create OCTA metapixels, and then wires, and then spaceship signals, and then logic gates, and then circuits...\n\n...29 billion GoL cells later, you get Tetris.  https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life\n\n> Is HolyC an esolang?\n\nYeah probs\n\n> Is Minecraft Redstone an esolang?\n\nYes! A lot of games have mechanisms you can use to build programs *inside* the game. Redstone is a good example, as are Factorio circuits and Baba is You blocks. There\'s no collective term for this category; I personally call them ""game-emergent languages"".\n\nThe big challenge with studying them is that, well, you have to have the game! I\'ve already given Factorio hundreds of hours of my life, I can\'t afford to download Minecraft, even if it\'s for ""research"".\n\n> You mispronounced ""Piet"".\n\nPiet Mondrian was a Dutch artist, so I\'m using the Dutch pronunciation of Piet (""Peet""). \n\n> Where\'s the music from?\n\nRichard Whaling\'s instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/BzVjW7LBv1K/.\n\n> Is that Ida Noyes?\n\nSCAV', '18:15\n\nJ is not an esolang at all üòÖ there are many real applications of J right now.', ""The Python program at around 14:09 can be simplified even further:\n1. you don't need a list comprehesion. you can use a generator comprehension, and when it's inside parentheses (from the function call), you don't need another pair of parentheses (so, remove the brackets, -2 bytes)\n2. you could use python truthiness, making `x!=1` into `x-1`, and `x%i!=0` into just `x%i` (-4 bytes)"", 'I was hoping to see the example shown in the screenshot (for computing PI).', ""That's funny that you mentioned Orca and did not mention Uxntal from the same authors.\nBut maybe it's not too esoteric i guess""]"
XZ3w_jec1v8,"""The Economics of Programming Languages"" by Evan Czaplicki (Strange Loop 2023)","In the mythology of open source, programming languages are created by people who seemingly have no direct economic function. They are just really good at compilers (somehow) and have a house to live in (somehow) and have a lifetime to devote to creating a useful programming language (somehow!)

We will examine specific organizations that create programming languages. Where do the salaries for compiler engineers come from? How does Go end up with 5 engineers and Dart end up with 30? Who signs off on these expenses and why? Does this put any boundaries on language design or development practices? And how do the economics work for people outside of the major tech corporations?

My goal is to give the talk I needed to hear 10 years ago when I was just starting on Elm. By clearly delineating the many variations of corporate funding and independent funding, I hope users will come away with a better foundation for evaluating and comparing programming languages.

Evan Czaplicki
Creator of Elm
@evancz

Evan is the creator and developer of the Elm programming language. He lives in Denmark, working alongside his wife at elm.studio to keep Elm independent and interesting.

ZFIeEV2HfPQ,The Generations of Programming Languages | Computer Science History,"Programming languages have progressed exponentially over the past half-century. The way you understand programming languages is split into high-level & low-level. But within that, there are five generations of programming languages. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th... pretty easy right? Whereas the 1st & 2nd being low-level languages. And the 3rd, 4th, 5th being high-level languages. You'll notice it progresses as it did through time, with machine language, assembly, Java, Python, and now with these visual tool programming languages.

 Programmer Larry Page offers language suggestions to amateur programmers who might not know exactly where to start.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Wall is the computer programmer responsible for creating Perl, a powerful general-purpose programming language known for its strengths in text processing. Wall, whose graduate work was in linguistics, designed Perl in 1987 for reports processing and continues to oversee the language's development according to the motto ""Larry is always right, even when he was wrong."" He also originated the three canonical ""virtues"" of a good programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
TRANSCRIPT: Back when I was getting started, lo these many decades ago, the answers would've been Fortran, Cobalt, Basic, Lisp, and maybe APL, and those were very formative languages back then and people learned a lot from those, but these days, it might be more important for you to know JavaScript, even if the only reason you know that is that you know whether or not to click the ""enable JavaScript"" button in your browser.  But JavaScript is a nice, lightweight, object-oriented language and that's why it can fit in a browser and do these things such as run little programs that help you input your data and then send it off to a web server somewhere.

There are heavier-weight object-oriented languages and the elephant in the room is sort of Java, you can't really make a list of modern languages without talking about it.  Java is sort of the Cobalt of the 21st century, I think. It's kind of heavyweight, verbose, and everyone loves to hate it, though not everyone will admit that.  But managers kind of like it because it looks like you're getting a lot done, you know, if 100 lines of Java code accomplish a task, then it looks like you've written 100 lines, even though in a different language, it might only take 5 lines.  You know, it's like, you know, you can eat a 1-pound steak or you can eat, you know, 100 pounds of shoe leather and you feel a greater sense of accomplishment after the shoe leather, but, you know, maybe they're some downsides.

Oh, what other languages?  I think going in a different direction, coming more from academia, we have a language like Haskell, which we call a functional programming language. That means function in a mathematical sense, not in the sense the other languages are dysfunctional.  But a function mathematically has an input and an output and it maps to, you know, with a great deal of mathematical certainty what those are.  Haskell is one of those languages that mathematician-type-minded people love; it's sort of a language for geniuses, by geniuses.  So you should probably know about it, if only to be able to say, ""Well, is this kind of like Haskell?""  And if so, then you know you have to hire some really smart people to program in it.  Haskell is sort of a modern kind of Lisp in that sense.

What else?  Well, we can't leave off modern languages without talking about C.  The C language, that‚Äôs just spelled with the letter C, is actually about 40 years old, but people have tried to replace C with other languages that are like it and have by and large not succeeded because C is a very minimalistic language and very close to the metal, as we say, on a machine, and lets you get down and do very fine grain stuff, very efficiently, but it's a lot of hard work.  But once you've done that work, you can run it pretty much everywhere.  So almost all the other languages that you see, Java, Perl, whatever, actually if you look down underneath, they're actually implemented in C, or in a closely related language.  So that continues to be a very fundamental language, if only because everyone is trying to reinvent it and not succeeding in doing so.

And finally, for a fifth language, well, you'd probably want to pick one of the scripting languages.  There's several to choose from, there's Python, there's Ruby, but of course, I am prejudiced in favor of Perl, because I think it has the liveliest community and because we have intentionally been redesigning it lately to leapfrog all the other languages. For the last number of years, we've been redesigning it to out all the warts that we've noticed over time.  And we figured it was just our one chance to break backward compatibility, break the things that need breaking, keep all the things that make Perl, Perl, keep it a joy to use, and with this redesign, make it a language that will be able to be useful and enjoyable for decades.  And so I'd recommend Perl, but I'm known to be prejudiced in the matter.",2011-06-13T16:38:29Z,UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg,Big Think,"['bigthink', 'Big Think', 'BigThink', 'BigThink.com', 'Larry Wall', 'programming languages', 'Java', 'programmers', 'Pearl', 'fortran', 'cobalt', 'BASIC', 'LISP', 'APL', 'javascript', 'object-orientated', 'industrial language', 'outsourcing', 'haskell', 'functional programming', 'mathematics', 'Python', 'Ruby', 'compatibility', '5 Programming Languages Everyone Should Know |', 'Programming languages for beginners', 'what programming language should i learn', 'larry wall big think', 'larry wall interview', 'larry wall lecture', 'larry wall programming languages']",28,,PT6M13S,1662592,13630,0,2642,"['Want to get Smarter, Faster‚Ñ¢?\r\nSubscribe for DAILY videos: https://bigth.ink/SmarterFaster', 'Perl sucks', 'Rockstar!', 'Thank you for share!', '2024:\n1.

New videos DAILY: https://bigth.ink/youtube

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
C should have been integrated as a subset of C++, says Stroustrup.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
BJARNE STROUSTRUP:

Bjarne Stroustrup is a computer programmer most famous for having designed and implemented the computer programming language C++, one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. His book ""The C++ Programming Language"" is the most widely read book of its kind and has been translated into at least 19 languages. In addition to his five books, Stroustrup has published hundreds of academic and popular papers. He currently holds the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
TRANSCRIPT:

Question: What is the difference between C and C++?

Bjarne Stroustrup:  C has the basic mechanisms for expressing computations.  It has iterations, it has data types, it has functions and that‚Äôs it.  It doesn‚Äôt get into the game of expressing abstractions.  So if I want a matrix in C, I would have to say, I want an array and then I want a whole bunch of arrays and when I want to get the third element I have to program my way down to the third element of the fourth row or something like that.  

In C++ you can define something, call it a matrix, you define a subscript operator. If you don‚Äôt want rectangular matrixes you can get pentadiagonal matrices, triangular matrices that‚Äôs the kind of stuff that people... the expert in that field are interested in.  And you build that set of concepts and then you program it directly.  It‚Äôs easier to program, it‚Äôs easier to debug and sometimes it‚Äôs even easier to optimize for performance when you are expressing the notions at the higher level, at the level where an expert in the field operates, rather than trying to have the expert in the field, say the physicist, also be an expert in dealing with the hardware, with the computer.  There are fields still where you have to have a physicist and a computer scientist to get the work done, but we would like to minimize those because the skill sets are not the same.  So you want to lift from the hardware towards the human level.  

Question: Is C obsolete?

Bjarne Stroustrup: This is somewhat controversial.  I think it is obsolete.  I think the languages should have been merged into one, so that C would have been a subset of C++ instead of nearly a subset of C++. And then people could have used whatever parts of the C++ tool set they needed.  As it is now, there are still enough incompatibilities that you have to remember which language you‚Äôre writing in, and I don‚Äôt think that is necessary.  It appears to be a historical necessity, but it is not a technical necessity.  

I‚Äôve argued for compatibility, very strong compatibility, all the time.  I mean, I started working on C++ three doors down from Dennis Ritchie and we were talking every day.  The competition and tension that has been between C and C++ over the decades certainly didn‚Äôt come from home.  

Dennis Ritchie wrote that first book that Brian Carnahan, now I‚Äôll have dinner with Brian next week.  We‚Äôre still very good friends as we‚Äôve always been, but sometimes the programmers of the languages don‚Äôt quite see it that way.  It should have been one language.

C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.",2024-11-19T01:48:31Z,UCZ7il9AWfJ78UwUuD3daKvg,Codotaku,"['c programming', 'practical tutorial', 'practical guide', 'practical', 'practical crash course', 'crash course', 'course', 'practical course', 'c programming language', 'programming', 'programming course', 'live', 'live coding', 'live programming', 'programming for beginners', 'programming tutorial', 'c crash course', 'c course', 'c programming tutorial', 'codotaku']",28,,PT2H19M54S,728,,0,0,
oZm_LhIfmWo,Top Programming Languages for Data Analyst,"Are you interested in becoming a data analyst? Then you need to know the top programming languages that are essential for every data analyst. In this short video, we'll introduce you to the five programming languages that every aspiring data analyst should know.

We start with Python, a powerful and versatile language that's used for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. We'll then move on to R, another popular language for data analysis, which has a strong statistical analysis package. SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is another essential language for data analysts.

We'll also introduce you to Java, which is used in big data technologies like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, and is great for handling large datasets. Lastly, we'll talk about JavaScript, a scripting language used for web development and creating interactive data visualizations.

By the end of this video, you'll have a good understanding of the programming languages that every data analyst should know. Start learning these languages and take your data analysis skills to the next level! Don't forget to follow our account for more content on data analysis and programming.

1Xrt28CKKMs,Which Programming Language To Learn First #01 | Desktop Application Programming Languages,"This video is part of a series that will help you discover which programming language to learn first. The only question you should ask yourself is ""What project have I always wanted to make while coding?"". This is a great question because it'll keep you engaged while you're learning because at the end of learning that particular language you'll be able to build out the project you've always wanted to do!

Today's video is about how to choose your first programming language to learn if your dream project is a desktop application. I will not be teaching you how to code, but which languages you should consider.

Developers who are moving towards Artificial intelligence and Machine learning are confused as which language is the best choice.
This video answers that.

In this video we will see :
- Which is the best language to learn AI
- In AI language doesn‚Äôt matter. Language is needed when we want to implement the algorithm.
- Selection of language based on 
     Ranking 
     Area of work 
     Background 
- Ranking
Based on use and number of libraries available the top 5 languages are :
1. Python 
2. Java 
3. C/C++
4. Javascript 
5. R language 

- Area of work or Domain :
If working on Natural Language Processing or Sentiment Analysis then Python is best language as there are many libraries available

If domain is Enterprise like Big Data, Fraud detection, Network security then best language is Java

If working on Robots, Speech recognition, Games then no doubt go for C and C++

- Tensorflow.js
- Javascript 
- R language

XdBLe6IazYA,Programming as a Second Language | Steve McIntosh | TEDxYouth@Dayton,"Most schools view computer programming as just a technical ability. Steve McIntosh challenges today‚Äôs school curriculums to view computer programming as a substitute for foreign language in that it has quickly become essential to society.  Steve McIntosh is a senior at The Miami Valley CTC where he is in the Game Programming & Web Applications class. He recently led a team to compete in the Miami Valley Teen Coding Challenge, where they took 1st place for ‚ÄúProject Bloodhound‚Äù, an NFC based tracking system. He enjoys programming, especially in Java, and solving problems. He hopes to move forward into software development or cyber security.

A3gTw1ZkeK0,Making a Programming Language & Interpreter in under 10 minutes!,"Creating a programming language is a dream for many programmers. In this video I go over how you can create a simple programming language and in interpreter for that language so you can run programs written in your own programming language. This will help you get started creating and understanding how make your own (more complex) programming language.

Make sure to let me know in the comments if you want to see this language being expanded. For the ability to do things such as assign variable or call functions.

To pick the right programming language for the cloud you need to know 2 things what type of app you're building and 2 what part of the cloud computing stack you plan to target For example if you simply plan to consume cloud-based services through a web browser JavaScript is the only language you'll need to know With JavaScript you can interact with object storage you can invoke RESTful web services and you can authenticate users with products like MongoDB Realm JavaScript is the language of the web browser but for server-side programming I'm a big fan of Java Java's been around for 30 years It has incredible community support and it has connectors for practically any backend resource you'd ever need to connect to For the creation of cloud native microservices Java is my number one choice",2024-07-22T18:23:56Z,UCAg98wtgZm1nEVTXGx3XShw,Darcy DeClute,"['scrum', 'agile', 'kanban', 'computerprogramming', 'computers', 'programming', 'aws', 'amazon', 'scrumban', 'certification', 'scrummaster', 'awspractitioner', 'awscertification', 'awscertified', 'development', 'developers']",27,en,PT52S,549,15,0,8,"['Oohh gooodd she said Java üò¢', 'Congratulations on 100 videos!', 'Java for the win.', ""I love microsoft java more for the backend, but it's just a matter of taste."", 'üíØüéâ']"

So much so that a 50 line custom polyfill script is far more usable and flexible than the entire vue core library. Actual download metrics collaborate this.\n\nNow, here is my rundown based on my experience.\nPython - I always looked at py as a lightweight scripting language. Something along the lines of lua but more, able to punch up to medium complexity. It is also relatively new, that still generates novelty buzz.\nC, C++ - There is no doubt in anyones mind if you want to learn to code and also want to learn what makes computers tick C is the way to go.\nC# and java - they both occupy prominent positions in enterprise software.  C# IMO is just plain better.\nJavascript - Availability, that is, a random rock next to a maple tree can probably run it."", ""Tiobe is a stupid ranking. It doesn't reflect the real world at all.

2aKfztEnN7k,EPISODE 4 - Scott & Mark Learn To... Pick a Programming Language,"In this episode of Scott & Mark Learn To, Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich dive into the quirks and philosophies of programming languages‚Äîdebating the purpose of small languages, like Erlang, versus giants like JavaScript. Along the way, they discuss whether modern languages with hindsight (like Kotlin) are inherently better and reminisce about the good old days of writing code in C, Delphi, and even 6502 assembler. Mark reflects on transitioning to Rust for system-level code in Azure, marking a deliberate move away from C/C++. He highlights Rust‚Äôs ownership model, memory safety, and enforced concurrency as the game-changers. Meanwhile, Scott is poking fun at the oddities of language trends, including Python‚Äôs rise to dominance in machine learning.

-J25FlKFYYk,Top 4 programming languages for game development,"In this video, we discuss the top 4 programming languages for game development.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this is the perfect place to start. 

There're many languages that may be used for game development. I have narrowed it down to the top 4 languages that I think are the most important in this field.

The first language on our list is Python. Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is a great language for beginners. With its extensive libraries such as Pygame, Arcade and Pygame Zero Python allows developers to create 2D games with ease. 

Next up is Lua, a popular language used in game development, particularly for scripting. It is widely used in game engines like Love2D and Roblox.

Moving on, we come to C#. As a powerful and versatile language, C# is commonly used in game development with the Unity game engine. Its ability to handle complex tasks and its strong support for object-oriented programming make it a favorite among game developers.

Lastly, we have C++. Known for its performance and speed, C++ is often used in AAA game development. It is the language of choice for game engines like Unreal Engine and is heavily utilized in the development of games for consoles like Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and Playstation.

In this series of discussing Coding Interview Questions , in this video I will discuss one coding question in which you will be given a code snippet and you need to tell the output of that code in C language.

Additionally I will debug the code and show you the debugging process step by step to give a better understanding of that question.

‚ñ∫Lesson Description: In this lesson we take a look at the Beef Language -- a language targeted towards game development. I stumbled on this language while watching this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmzS9vz6h30) produced by Digital Foundry about Penny's Big Breakway video game (made by Evening Star). I think this is quite an impressive project, so I had to see why the developers took the risk (and reaped the reward) of using a new language. I am not sponsored by any of these parties, but I do want to put a link to the game -- as 2024 has been a hard year for game developers around the world: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1955230/Pennys_Big_Breakaway/. The hacker news article can also be found here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21991382.  As always, let me know what resources/tools I missed that others should know about in the comments below!

üåêTimeline of the most popular programming languages since 1965 to 2024. So far the most intense ranking I've ever done :) For recent years I've used multiple programming languages popularity indexes with adjustments thanks to the data from GitHub repositories access frequency. For historical ranking I've used aggregation of multiple national surveys to establish several data points, plus a world wide publications rate of occurrence. In this ranking popularity is defined by percentage of programmers with either proficiency in specific language or currently learning/mastering one. Y axis a relative value to define ranking popularity between all other items.

üìà Witness the dynamic landscape of coding languages as we traverse the decades, highlighting the significant milestones and revolutionary shifts that have shaped the way we write and execute code. From the early days of Fortran and COBOL to the modern era dominated by Python, JavaScript, and beyond, this video is a deep dive into the heart of the programming world.

üåç Explore the reasons behind the popularity of each language, their key features, and their impact on the tech industry. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a coding enthusiast, or simply curious about the evolution of programming languages, this video has something for everyone.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this video has something for everyone!

A programming language is a formal set of instructions that allows humans to communicate with computers. It provides a structured way to write commands that the computer can interpret and execute, enabling the creation of software applications. Programming languages aim to simplify complex tasks, automate processes, and solve problems efficiently by enabling programmers to develop, debug, and maintain code effectively.

A GPU is a separate bank of ALUs and FPUs, designed to offload heavily parallelizable calculations from the main CPU onto a dedicated chip. The Graphics Card refers to the entire sub-system, containing the PCB, Memory, and Cooling solution. 

Building a Budget PC can be tough. Not only are GPUs and CPUs so incredibly expensive, but they can be hard to find on a budget... But, there are tips and tricks to finding you your dream Budget GPU, and pairing it with a CPU that will give you the performance you want!

Also, if you're reading this far - I've got more content coming!

Have a Great Day!

1v8rNIvrLB8,How to Create Your Own Programming Language - Episode 1: The Overview,"Creating a programming language is simpler than you might think. My goal with this, potentially short, series of videos is to give you a deeper understanding of programming languages and to not be afraid to start making your own. 

In this episode, I'll be going over how a programming language is parsed, as well as the grammar of the simple arithmetic language we will be building.

Due to some useful criticism, this series has been redesigned from the ground up. If, for some reason, you'd like to watch the original: https://youtu.be/GjOmGZgC_RU

What's my story? An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. 

How is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. 

What am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap.

Meaning of High-Level Language

High-level language (HLL) is created for developing user-friendly software and programs. It enables people to write programs easily in their native language like English, Spanish, etc. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language.  It is easy to read, write, and maintain.

Example of High-Level Language

1.)  Python
2.)  Java
3.)  C++
4.)  C#
5.)  Visual Basic
6.)  JavaScript
7.)  Objective C, 
8.)  Cobol,
9.)  Pascal,  
10.)  FORTRAN 

Advantages of High-Level Language

1.) High-level languages are programmer-friendly. 
2.) It is a machine-independent language.
3.) Easy to learn,  write, and maintain.
4.) Easy to find errors.
5.) Increase the productivity of the programmer.

Disadvantages of High-Level Language

1.) It takes additional translation times to translate the source to machine code.
2.) High-level programs are comparatively slower than low-level programs.
3.) A program written in machine language is more efficient than a high-level language.
4.) It requires more memory storage.

‚ñ∫Lesson Description: In this lesson we take a look at C3! This is also the first time we are going to be live streaming and looking at a programming language! A big thanks to the community for 20,000 subscribers. The C3 language (evolved from C2) is an intriguing path for evolution for the C language. We'll look at some of the capabilities including slices, modules, reflection, and the types. It was interesting to see that the 'names' of types are cased with uppercase letters for consistency. Some other quality of life improvements in the language were also interesting (i.e. 'fn' function names, 'def', the 'macro' explicit label for compile-time functions). As always, let me know what resources/tools I missed that others should know about in the comments below!

I've since added that, but if you wondered why that didn't work, that was the reason. If you had defined say `float[<3>] v1` it would have worked fine.\n\nThe last thing you got stuck on was iterating over the `membersof`, that's because it returns an untyped list that you're only able to iterate over during compile time. So if you would have used `$foreach` (compile time foreach) it would have worked fine. I think the error message was pretty bad though, and it will be improved in 0.6.1\n\nIt was great feedback seeing someone speedrun through the language just using the docs. Thank you again for that."", 'I wish you created a series on C3 similar to c by example or something like that. It looks really great.', ""c, c#, c3 and c4 (carbon). Programmers are drawining in a sea of c's"", 'Mike, between C3 and Odin, which one  you like the best and why?', ""Looks like an interesting language there are however a few things that I don't like, new_init() and free(), that is one of those typical things you can quite easily forget and to me that is just boilerplate code. Also memory management in general, having to call free is just annoying, there should be a way to specify lifetime or a concept like unique_ptr/shared_ptr, we really shouldn't have to deal with this.""]"

This video is based on the *Top 10 dying programming languages in 2023* , which will inform you about the top 10 programming languages that will be outdated in 2023. If you are planning to upskill yourself and improve your programming skills, then this video will help you understand the programming languages to avoid in 2023. 

Here is the list of *Top 10 Dying Programming Languages 2023*
üî¥ 00:00 *Top 10 Dying Programming Languages 2023*
üî¥ 01:02 *CoffeeScript*

üî¥ 01:36 *Ruby*

üî¥ 02:16 *VBA*
*VBA* was one of the most extensively used programming languages. Despite being based on .NET, it is no longer updated by Microsoft, indicating its obsolescence.

üî¥ 02:55 *Scala*
*Scala* performance was not the issue however, most developers were unaware of features of Scala. Thereby, adding it in the list of dying programming languages

üî¥ 03:27 *Objective C*
Verbose nature, complex syntax, and outdated libraries of *Objective C*, made developers switch to swift for the ease of code readability and application development, thus adding it to the list of dying programming languages

üî¥ 04:06 *Perl* 
It is one of the most efficient open-source languages for text manipulation. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, *Perl* comes with a major drawback. Perl fails to support portability because of CPAN modules. Programs run slowly and must be interpreted each time any changes are made. 

üî¥ 04:45 *Haskell*
*Haskell* has faced issues like no proper IDE support, complex syntax, and a steep learning curve. This forced developers to migrate to better alternatives, thereby adding it into the list of dying programming languages.

*Top 3 Dying Programming Languages 2023*

üî¥ 05:26 *Fortran*
*Fortran* is in the list of dying programming languages because developers soon had to migrate to other languages due to a lack of dynamic memory, reliability, and unsafe code prone to cyber threats. 

üî¥ 06:05 *Erlang*
*Erlang* supported banking, e-commerce, computer systems development, and instant messaging services. Due to its complex debugging procedures and critical deployment issues it is not in use recent days.

üî¥ 06:41 *Cobol*
The early main frame programming for business transactions, banking, and many more was handled by *COBOL*. It had a tougher verbose syntax with slow compilation and deployment.

dh_t2xYVxV4,Generations of programming languages(in telugu) | by vikram dunga,"There are five generations of Programming languages. They are: 
First-Generation Languages : 
These are low-level languages like machine language. 
Second-Generation Languages : 
These are low-level assembly languages used in kernels and hardware drives. 
Third-Generation Languages : 
These are high-level languages like C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, and JavaScript. 
Fourth Generation Languages : 
These are languages that consist of statements that are similar to statements in the human language. These are used mainly in database programming and scripting. Examples of these languages include Perl, Python, Ruby, SQL, and MatLab(MatrixLaboratory). 
Fifth Generation Languages :

Programming Language in Hindi is a part of #SoftwareBasics_Series_by_Techmoodly_2022, Here we have explained all aspect of Programming Language and types of Computer Programming Language



üéØ More Information on Video:
Source: Wikipedia

A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[1] The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.

Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

What is Roblox?
Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox",2024-11-21T11:15:09Z,UCAYeLUQj1BhFhbJzZqKROmg,Cheesymembey,[],20,en,PT22S,46047,2772,0,49,"['Bacon pro:i cought bigger fish than youüòÇ: chessy:üíÄ', 'Make a video when you get her banned and she begs for you not to do it ‚ù§‚ù§', 'I need only isonade and ducky to go to the depths', 'Ty hat mich gerade angeschrieben üòäüòÖ', 'This is how you spell sad']"

------------------------------------------------
Key Tips for Beginners
------------------------------------------------

Starting a new language can feel overwhelming, but with the right approach, it's more manageable than it seems. First, set realistic goals, like learning 5-10 new words weekly. Achievable milestones give you a sense of progress and keep you motivated. Next, build a routine by dedicating 10-15 minutes a day to study. 

Consistency is crucial, and it makes language learning a daily habit. Finally, embrace mistakes as part of the journey. Making errors is normal and provides valuable learning opportunities. By being patient and persistent, you‚Äôll improve over time and gain confidence in your new language skills.

------------------------------------------------
Finding the Right Approach for Your Learning Style
------------------------------------------------

Language learning isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. Identifying a method that suits your learning style can significantly enhance your experience. Audio-based programs like Pimsleur are perfect for learners who want to practice listening and speaking hands-free, ideal for those who enjoy conversational training while multitasking. 

Alternatively, platforms like Babbel offer structured lessons that blend speaking, reading, writing, and grammar. This variety caters to visual and interactive learners who prefer a comprehensive, balanced approach. Ultimately, selecting a tool that keeps you engaged will ensure you stay motivated and maximize your language learning journey.

------------------------------------------------
Comparing Pimsleur and Babbel
------------------------------------------------

Pimsleur and Babbel each offer unique advantages. Pimsleur‚Äôs audio-based method immerses learners in listening and speaking, making it excellent for travel-focused individuals aiming to converse confidently. Its hands-free design means you can practice on the go, although it may lack depth in reading and writing exercises. Babbel, however, delivers a more structured experience, ideal for learners seeking well-rounded language skills. 

It includes grammar, vocabulary, and optional live classes for personalized feedback, but it may be less immersive for those who crave immediate conversation practice. Both tools have strengths, so consider your goals to choose the right one. Check the description for affiliate links to potentially score a discount!

#AIChess, #ReinforcementLearning, #AlphaZero, #ChessEngine, #ArtificialIntelligence, #AIExplained, #HowAIWorks, #ChessAI, #AIvsHumans, #deepmind 

How does a computer learn to play chess‚Äîand even beat grandmasters? ü§ñ‚ôüÔ∏è It‚Äôs all thanks to reinforcement learning, an advanced AI technique! In this video, we break down how computers like DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaZero mastered chess in just hours by playing millions of games against themselves. Starting with random moves, these AI systems learn from trial and error, gradually improving their strategy to maximize wins.

AlphaZero rewrote the rules by relying solely on self-play‚Äîno human guidance required! Using reinforcement learning, it analyzed millions of positions and outcomes, transforming into an unbeatable chess engine. Whether you‚Äôre fascinated by artificial intelligence, chess, or both, this video explains the incredible journey from randomness to mastery.
