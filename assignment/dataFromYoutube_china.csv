🥒 *ABOUT BEFRS:*
Hey, I’m Sonny! I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.

If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. Peace!

CIImokffzvw,What Really Happens at the North Korea / China Border?,"North Korea is the most interesting and isolated country in the world, so I went to the border town with China to investigate what is going on.  I often think about my trip to Pyongyang, North Korea back in April 2017 - it was a completely bizarre experience.  All Americans are banned from going back, so for now, this is the closest I could get to stepping foot on North Korean soil.

If you ever got the chance, would you visit North Korea? Comment below and share your thoughts!

p49QRxO_n2c,Chongqing - Nightlife in the Chinese megacity | DW Documentary,"If you want to experience China, you can't avoid Chongqing. This megacity is growing at a blistering place.  But beware, it is not a place for anyone with a fear of heights, or a sensitive stomach.

The population of Chongqing, in southwestern China, has exploded over the last 30 years: now, some 32 million people live here. Covering an area the size of Austria, Chongqing is one of the largest cities in the world in terms of physical size. 

In China, the megacity has become a tourist magnet. It’s known for its unique spots for snapping photos, like the train that runs right through the eighth floor of a high-rise building. Social media influencers have contributed to popularizing the city, once known mainly as an arrival or departure point for cruise tourists. 

The people of Chongqing have a reputation for being particularly warm-hearted. City guide Zhen Jili, for example, knows every corner of his city, and has witnessed first-hand how his ""big village"" became a megacity. He takes visitors through his remarkable metropolis, where GPS is useless, because you never know which floor your destination is on.

Professional ""designated driver"" Shen Xun takes the film’s viewers along on his journey through Chongqing's raucous nightlife, where the party doesn‘t end until morning. Because there is a strict ban on drinking and driving in China, anyone who has had a drink can call Shen Xun. He then arrives on his little folding bike, which he stows in the trunk before chauffeuring his customers home in their car. 

Livestreamers like Paipai can be seen on every street corner in Chongqing. She explains why livestreaming is a billion-dollar business in China, and takes viewers to one of the city's tallest buildings, for a view from right in the middle of the skyline.

JA1LWl02CrA,Why the Chinese Economy is Stronger Than You Think,"The Chinese economy is stronger than you think. China has an innovation ecosystem where it builds up young entrepreneurs and industries with government support. It's investing billions into the Global South and 150 countries on the Belt and Road Initiative, and with 1.4 billion people, it remains the most lucrative consumer market in the world. Bottom line, never bet against China!

hIWiofm_Skw,Xi’s Implicit Warning To Trump? China Tells Biden ‘Taiwan And…’ Are Four Red Lines US Mustn’t Cross,"Chinese President Xi Jinping warned the United States on Saturday not to cross a ""red line"" in support for Taiwan, but told his counterpart Joe Biden that Beijing was willing to work with the incoming administration of Donald Trump.

Biden and Xi met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru, two months before Trump takes office and amid concerns of new trade wars and diplomatic upheaval.

China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has refused to rule out using force to seize it, while the United States is the self-ruled island's main security backer even though it does not recognise Taipei diplomatically.

Xi told Biden that the ""Taiwan issue, democracy and human rights, pathways and systems, and development interests are China's four red lines that must not be challenged"", according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.

""These are the most important guardrails and safety net for China-US relations,"" CCTV reported Xi as saying.

""The separatist actions of 'Taiwan independence' are incompatible with peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he added.

Taiwan's foreign ministry said Sunday that ""China's ongoing military provocations near Taiwan are the root cause of destroying regional peace and stability and the major threat to global economic prosperity"".

Letra:
En un bosque de la China
la chinita se perdió
como yo andaba perdido
nos encontramos los dos

Era de noche y la chinita
tenía miedo, miedo tenía de andar solita
anduvo un rato y se sentó 
junto a la china, junto a la china me senté yo

Y yo que si y ella que no
y yo que si y ella que nooooo.
Y al cabo fuimos y al cabo fuimos
y al cabo fuimos de una opinión

Bajo el cielo de la China
la chinita se sentó
y la luna en ese instante
indiscreta la besó

Luna envidiosa, luna importuna
tenía celos, celos tenía de mi fortuna
Anduvo un rato y se sentó 
junto a la china, junto a la china me senté yo

MIRACULOUS - TALES OF LADYBUG & CAT NOIR OFFICIAL YOUTUBE CHANNEL
Two high-school students, Marinette and Adrien, are chosen to become Paris’ superheroes: Ladybug and Cat Noir. They each have a Miraculous, a jewel linked to the magical creatures (Kwamis) that give them powers.
Their mission is to keep Hawk Moth – who wants to steal their Miraculouses – from wreaking havoc on the town by creating ever fiercer supervillains – all while living their high school lives and keeping their identities secret.
At school, Marinette has a crush on Adrien but cannot tell him, so she acts awkwardly whenever he is around. As a superhero, Cat Noir loves Ladybug, but his ego annoys her: besides, Marinette prefers Adrien anyway!
Throughout the school year and their adventures, Ladybug discovers many nice qualities in Cat Noir while Marinette grows ever closer to Adrien, making huge efforts to overcome her shyness.

The adventure in Paris continues for Ladybug and Cat Noir, surrounded by new allies and fighting an ever more powerful and determined opponent. But great changes lie ahead for Ladybug and Cat Noir in their superhero lives, and for Marinette and Adrien in their lives at school.

dkkk-aqhcxo,China: Jugend unter Xi Jinping | ARTE Reportage,"Staats- und Parteichef Xi Jinping verspricht seit einigen Jahren „Wohlstand für alle“ und für China die „globale Führung“. Nun stagniert die Wirtschaft, die Immobilienpreise fallen ins Bodenlose und die Jugendarbeitslosigkeit lag zeitweise bei über 20 Prozent.

Xi Jinping aber lässt lieber die Statistiken zensieren und die Berichterstattung über die Krise unterdrücken. Die Jugend solle jetzt eben lernen, Bitterkeit zu ertragen, so wie der Staatschef selbst, der während der Kulturrevolution unter Mao gegen Ende der sechziger bis Anfang der siebziger Jahre auf dem Land schuften und hungern musste. 
Und was machen die jungen Leute, wenn sie nach einem teuren Studium an einer Eliteuni keinen Job finden? Manche praktizieren „tang ping“ (sich flach hinlegen) und „bai lan“ (es einfach laufen lassen) als eine stille Form des Protests gegen den ständigen Leistungsdruck und die Erwartungen der Gesellschaft. Viele junge Menschen ziehen sich aus der urbanen Leistungsgesellschaft zurück und suchen nach alternativen Lebenswegen auf dem Land oder als sogenannte „bezahlte Kinder“ bei ihren Eltern. 
Unser Reporter gewann das Vertrauen von drei jungen Leuten, dem 24-jährigen Uni-Absolventen Tianqing, der 30-jährigen Marketing-Managerin Qianqian und dem 28-jährigen Lieferfahrer Erchui. Die ersten beiden suchen schon länger verzweifelt nach einem neuen gut bezahlten Job und der dritte hofft auf bessere Zeiten, irgendwann…

XI’AN, CHINA - Today we’re going on an ultimate 14 hour Chinese street food tour in the ancient city of Xi’an, China. If you love to eat, this city in China is a food paradise, from bustling outdoor markets, to the Muslim quarter, and never ending chili oil, we’re about to taste some of the best Chinese food that Xi’an has to offer. 

Xiaonanmen Morning Market (小南门市场) - We’re staring in the morning along the Wall of Xi’an at Xiaonanmen Morning Market. Here you’ll find a plethora of street food and colorful ingredients. We tried the spicy tofu bean curd - 3 RMB ($0.43), the very popular Xi'an pork burger (肘子夹馍) - 10 RMB ($1.43), sticky rice dessert (Zeng Gao (甑糕) - 6 RMB ($0.86), and finally fried vegetable pocket (菜合).

Luzhi Liangfen (老何家卤汁凉粉) - Next up we’re continuing this Chinese street food tour in the Muslim Quarter of Xi’an and trying a very unique dish of bean jelly noodles - Price - 17 RMB ($2.42).

Lao Jiajia Pepper Soup (老贾家胡辣汤) - Although it doesn’t look like much, hulatang (胡辣汤) - hot pepper soup, is extremely flavorful and this is one of the best bowls in Xi’an. 

Liuxinniu Mutton Soup (刘信牛羊肉泡馍) - You can’t visit Xi’an without trying Yangrou Paomo (羊肉泡馍) - a lamb and flatbread soup that’s cooked over a rocket jet flame. This dish truly shows the diversity and cultural crossroads - at the beginning of the Silk Road - that Xi’an is! Price - 28 RMB ($3.99)

Ma'er Youzhi Suantang Dumplings (马二优质酸汤水饺) - Next door you'll find a dumpling jacuzzi where you can enjoy some of the best sour soup dumplings you’ll ever have in your life. Price - 16 RMB ($2.28) 

Liuxiang Noodle Restaurant (柳巷面) - Next up on this Chinese food tour, we headed to this legendary restaurant for hand pulled noodles known as Gungun noodles. This was one of the best bowls of noodles I’ve had in a long time. Price - 22 RMB ($3.14) 

Zhubashi Wangjiao BBQ (竹笆市旺角烤肉) - Finally, another famous food in Xi’an, China is cumin lamb bbq, and as they grill it, they sprinkle it with cumin and chili pepper - it’s some of the best lamb ever. Price - 129 RMB ($18.39) for everything

Xi’an is a Chinese street food paradise, you’ll never run out of amazing food to try!

x2PWBkPBxNM,Entering The World's Narrowest City,"Welcome to Yanjin, China - the narrowest city in the world!  This place is AWESOME!

More than 100,000 people call this unique city home, living in high-rise buildings along a narrow strip of land between steep mountains and the polluted brown River. It’s truly mind-blowing to see how Yanjin has adapted to its natural environment, with its residents making the most of every inch of space available. The towering mountains in every direction make it feel as though the city is trapped in a stunning, yet challenging, landscape. In all of my travels, I've never seen anything like this!

Also - this is my first time visiting rural China, and I have to admit, it’s been a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of massive cities like Beijing or Shanghai. The slower pace, tight-knit community, and the way life carries on here, despite the obvious limitations, have been truly eye-opening. 

Mainland China is full of surprises, and Yanjin is just one of the many hidden gems that I've discovered on this 18 day trip. Stay tuned for the next five videos in my China series, where I’ll be uncovering even more fascinating and lesser-known places across this incredible country! Woohoo!

Thanks to @littlechineseeverywhere for coming on this adventure with me! She makes awesome content (in English) around China!

HTS2plAOXDM,Journey Through China's Cities - Urban Travel Documentary,"Get Surfshark VPN at https://surfshark.deals/hoffer - Enter promo code HOFFER for 83% off and get 3 extra months for free!

China is one of the world’s most fascinating and complicated countries, and its cities seem to get bigger every year. Considered a rural society just a few decades ago, China today is home to the world’s largest urban population. 

In this travel documentary, I take you on a journey through some of the country’s most interesting cities. While many city centers are filled with modern skyscrapers, we also search for more traditional neighborhoods, historic sites, tranquil parks, special events, and cultural activities. We look at the rapid changes China is undergoing in its urbanization process, and mention some of the challenges the country is facing. 

From the modern megacities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou we travel to the ancient centers of Beijing and Xian. We visit the popular Summer holiday beaches of coastal Qingdao, and the exciting Winter festivals of Harbin. From the streets of fusion cities like Hong Kong and Macau we continue our journey to Tibetan Lhasa, located on the Rooftop of the World. We also take a look at the disappearing alleys of old Kashgar, in the controversial Xinjiang region, and the empty streets of Ordos, China’s best known ghost town. And we explore the expanding urban centers along the Yangtze river, including Wuhan and Chongqing, all the way to the fast paced metropolis of Shanghai. 

I traveled through China independently for more than a decade, on several occasions. The footage in this video was shot between 2010 and 2019, and is accompanied by background information. For more in-depth information on each place, I recommend to read, watch, and listen to as many different sources as you can.

Here’s a brief overview of the content in this video:

We begin our journey in Shanghai, one of China’s most remarkable cities. Its skyline has become a symbol for the country’s economic growth. While we look at the modern face of Shanghai, I also visit some more traditional neighborhoods, even though they are disappearing fast.

We travel onwards to Harbin, in the North of China, to visit a spectacular Winter festival, with sculptures and palaces made from ice and snow, which draws millions of tourists every year. Beijing, the nation’s capital, is our next destination. This is the political heart of China, but also brims with culture and creativity.

In Chongqing, located on the mighty Yangtze river, we witness some of the urbanization process, while in Lhasa we look at the traditions and customs of the Tibetan people. We travel onwards to Xian, where we walk on the ancient city walls, eat some delicious food in the Muslim neighborhood, and visit the magnificent Terracotta Army. 

After Xian, we travel to Ordos, China’s best known ‘ghost town’. After which we continue our way to Kashgar, in the now controversial Xinjiang region, where the faith of the Uyghur people hangs in the balance. Qingdao is our next destination, one of China’s most beautiful coastal cities, where we also explore some of the suburbs. 

Hong Kong is perhaps the perfect mix between East and West. A short ferry ride away, Macau retains some of its Portuguese history, but is also known as the ‘Las Vegas of Asia’ with its many casinos. Just across the ‘border’ from both, Shenzhen has grown into one of China’s largest and wealthiest cities, while it was just a small fishing village 40 years ago. 

The last two cities we visit are Wuhan and Guangzhou, which have their own distinct character. I visited Wuhan before the pandemic broke out, and found a sprawling city. Guangzhou is also a vast metropolis, and is known for its Cantonese culture and cuisine.

The two leaders are expected to hold talks on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in the Peruvian capital, Lima.

It comes against the backdrop of increasing tension in the US-China relationship with a potential trade war looming under a Trump presidency, several China hawks tapped for US cabinet positions and China's growing status among global south countries as an emerging leader of an alternative world order.

But China is also setting up a huge global network of ports, as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. China needs ports as the world's top export nation. It needs access to key trade routes to keep its economy running. But Chinese ports are about more than just trade.

RELATED: Former Chinese President Hu Jintao removed from Communist Party congress https://bit.ly/3UCZgkx

President Joe Biden said after his meeting Monday with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he is confident China is not preparing to attack Taiwan.

""I'm committed to keeping the lines of communications open between you and me personally, but also our governments across the board,"" Biden told Xi on Monday, emphasizing both countries share a responsibility to ""manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever to near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation.""

Xi responded: ""The world has come to a crossroads. Where to go from here – this is a question that is not only on our mind but also on the mind of all countries. The world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship.""

YVMj8STa4Tg,Elektroautos - Wer stoppt China? | Mit offenen Karten | ARTE,"Ein Land scheint bei den E-Autos allen voraus zu sein: China. Sei es bei der Produktion oder beim Zugang zu Rohstoffen – die Volksrepublik positioniert sich als Branchenführer und könnte schon bald den Weltmarkt überschwemmen. Das E-Auto ist nicht zuletzt ein strategischer Faktor für Umwelt, Wirtschaft – und Geopolitik ...

Die seit Jahrzehnten globalisierte Automobilindustrie erlebt seit dem Aufkommen des Elektroautos eine wahre Revolution. In Zeiten des ökologischen Wandels scheinen umweltfreundlichere und sparsamere Fahrzeuge unumgänglich. Zahlreiche Länder haben für die kommenden Jahre verbindliche Absatzquoten für Elektroautos eingeführt, die einen lukrativen Markt versprechen. Europäische, amerikanische, japanische und koreanische Autohersteller stellen nach und nach um.
Doch ein Land scheint allen voraus zu sein: China. Sei es bei der Produktion oder beim Zugang zu Rohstoffen – die Volksrepublik positioniert sich als Branchenführer und könnte schon bald den Weltmarkt mit Elektroautos überschwemmen, deren Preise weit unter denen der Konkurrenz liegen. Das Elektroauto ist nicht zuletzt ein strategischer Faktor für Umwelt, Wirtschaft – und Geopolitik.

JB9jBpX1yx8,Trump Is Facing a Losing Tariff War With China,"The US and China are locked in a battle for tech supremacy, and it’s set to be a major challenge for Donald Trump. Years of tariffs, export controls and financial sanctions have done little to slow Xi Jinping’s quest for dominance. China has become a world leader in industries like electric vehicles and solar power, and it's catching up in others. But even though the US hasn’t managed to trip China up yet, there’s no sign it's going to stop trying.

U0EySK4T2aY,The secret behind how Chinese characters work - Gina Marie Elia,"Trace the history of Chinese characters, and find out how this writing system has changed and evolved over thousands of years.

--

According to legend, in the 27th century BCE, the Yellow Emperor of China charged his historian, Cangjie, to develop a system of writing. Sitting alongside a riverbank, Cangjie noted the imagery that surrounded him. From this, he created the first Chinese characters. So, how has Chinese evolved in the last 3,000 years? Gina Marie Elia explores the history of one of the earliest written languages.

Fm-QRow2zzI,El nuevo orden mundial de China y la dependencia de Occidente | DW Documental,"Las buenas relaciones con China garantizaron a la economía alemana productos baratos y ganancias. Pero la relación se volvió dependiente. El documental ""En la boca del dragón: ¿Cómo replantear la relación con China?” muestra hasta dónde llega esto.

En la cumbre sobre el gran proyecto de infraestructura de la ""Nueva Ruta de la Seda” celebrada en octubre de 2023, el presidente chino, Xi Jinping, apareció al lado del presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin. Ya sea en Asia o en Oriente Medio, China parece estar esforzándose por un nuevo orden mundial en competencia con Occidente. 

Y esto ya está teniendo consecuencias para Alemania. El comercio con China ha sido durante mucho tiempo un negocio brillante: Volkswagen, por ejemplo, inundó el mercado chino con automóviles a partir de 1984 y llegó a vender a China uno de cada tres autos que producía. Pero ahora empresas chinas como BYD dominan el mercado de los autos eléctricos. En el caso de los chips informáticos, los antibióticos o las células solares la dependencia alemana de China conlleva riesgos. 

China está ganando cada vez más terreno no sólo económica sino también políticamente, ya sea en la guerra de Ucrania, en las relaciones con Rusia o en su posición de fuerza con respecto a Taiwán. Mientras que antes China actuaba con moderación y, como socio en un mundo global, garantizaba a Occidente cómodos beneficios, ahora reclama un papel como potencia mundial. En Berlín, los políticos empiezan a tomar conciencia de una relación que se ha vuelto muy dependiente. Romperla no es posible, pero sí tal vez replantearla.

oetCTEnB3bA,China’s $31 BILLION Three Gorges Dam Is COLLAPSING!,"China’s $31 BILLION Three Gorges Dam Is COLLAPSING! 

The Three Gorges Dam has recently been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. The alarming news of its potential collapse has sent shockwaves through the world, raising concerns about the catastrophic consequences that could follow. What's surprising is that a dam that cost China a whopping 31 billion dollars to build and became operational fairly recently, could collapse. Right now, the three gorges dam is on high alert as recent floods triggered by torrential rains wreaked havoc in the country, and experts are worried due to the dam’s weak capability of withstanding heavy floods. Today let’s delve into the potential collapse of the Three Gorges Dam and investigate the scale of this impending disaster.

U0EySK4T2aY,The secret behind how Chinese characters work - Gina Marie Elia,"Trace the history of Chinese characters, and find out how this writing system has changed and evolved over thousands of years.

--

According to legend, in the 27th century BCE, the Yellow Emperor of China charged his historian, Cangjie, to develop a system of writing. Sitting alongside a riverbank, Cangjie noted the imagery that surrounded him. From this, he created the first Chinese characters. So, how has Chinese evolved in the last 3,000 years? Gina Marie Elia explores the history of one of the earliest written languages. 

Lesson by Gina Marie Elia, directed by PeiHsin Cho.

👉 SUBSCRIBE for more: https://www.youtube.com/@MarkAbroad 
👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/   

Today we’re on a mission to eat the best Chinese mutton soup I’ve ever had! The restaurant is located in Weinan, about an hour outside of Xi’an, in the Shaanxi province of China. The cooking actually begins the day before, where 4 whole sheets are added to a jacuzzi sized pot, and boiled overnight within their own fat, along with Chinese cardamom, dry chilies, and Sichuan pepper. 

They open at 6 AM and the meat is falling off the bone tender. When they serve you, you get some of the meat chopped in your bowl, topped with Sichuan pepper oil, coriander and and handful of fresh Sichuan pepper. It’s an overdose of flavor, and the mutton will melt in your mouth. 

Weinan Gushi Mutton Soup (渭南故市张家水盆)  
Price - 25 RMB ($3.57) per bowl

Terracotta Army - One of China’s most important historical sites is the Terracotta Army. It was amazing to see in person, the size and scale is truly impressive, and it’s a place you can’t miss when you visit Xi’an - actually many people visit Xi’an just to visit the famous Terracotta Army. Entrance Price - 120 RMB ($17.11) per person 

Biang Biang Noodles (油泼扯面) - Just a five minute drive from the Terracotta Army, Michael took us to eat one of his favorite Biang Biang Noodles. They were outstanding, you can never have enough noodles and chili oil in Xi’an, China! Price - 16 RMB ($2.28)

Somewhere in rural China, there’s a replica city that is straight out of the American Wild West – Welcome to Jackson Hole, China!  With a jaw-dropping $170 million invested to recreate that classic cowboy vibe in Wyoming, I knew that I had to see this for myself. Is it really as “American” as they claim? Are people actually living there, or is it a ghost town?  

To help me get to the bottom of it, I teamed up with my friend Rachel, a fellow American who’s been living in China for 8 years and speaks conversational Mandarin. Together, we’re diving into this strange town to uncover the truth – from cowboy hats to horse riding to sizzling steaks, we’re exploring just how wild (and weird) this “Western” town really is.

kMhle4o0uk0,Why China and the US are so obsessed with Taiwan | Mapped Out,"The US-China superpower rivalry is on full display in Taiwan. Beijing wants control of the island and is willing to use force to get it.  Washington has been ambiguous about how it would respond but is expanding its military presence in the region. Taiwan is at the center of the US first island chain strategy to contain China. A standoff seems almost unavoidable. But what factors give the tiny island such an outsize importance for both superpowers? And why is neither side backing down? 
 We speak to foreign policy experts Victor Gao (Center for China and Globalization) and David Sacks (Council on Foreign Relations) and find out what people in Taiwan think of the tensions.

China is conducting a mega air show In the southern city of Zhuhai. A lot of aircraft, drones and naval equipment are on display. But the show has two top attractions. One is a stealth fighter jet - called the J-35A. It's being billed as Beijing's answer to America's F-35. The second top attraction is not even Chinese. It's a Russian SU-57 jet which is on display at this year's air show. But what is a Russian jet doing here? And what does China hope to achieve with this display of military might? Palki Sharma tells you.

*Synopsis | Sending a Message (2024)*
It might not be a conventional tactic, but military forces all around the world love to show off.  And it’s exactly what the United States and 28 of its allies, including Australia, is currently doing on and around the Hawaiian islands. RIMPAC 2024, as it’s called, is an extraordinary spectacular of the world’s most lethal weaponry. It’s loud, menacing and quite overwhelming. For this story, reporter Dimity Clancey and her team were granted extraordinary access to the operation, which included filming on board the massive USS Carl Vinson Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, as well as securing a rare interview with the US Chief of Naval Operations and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Lisa Franchetti. America and its partners view RIMPAC 2024 as the perfect opportunity to send a decisive message to any would-be adversaries: Mess with us at your peril.

LBIrhxu-NRg,"US Navy Submarine SURFACES WITHIN Chinese Fleet, Then THIS Happened...","As US-China tensions reach new heights, the stakes beneath the ocean's surface are just as intense. Imagine a US Navy submarine suddenly surfacing in the middle of a Chinese fleet—an act that could instantly escalate into a major geopolitical crisis.What happens when a US submarine suddenly surfaces in the heart of a Chinese fleet? The answer could spark chaos and reshape global power in an instant.
First, a little context to understand how we got here. The US and Chinese navies have navigated a precarious balance of tension and cautious cooperation for decades. After World War II, the US Navy reigned supreme in the Pacific—unchallenged, until China began its rapid naval expansion in the late 20th century. The first real test of this growing rivalry came during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1996, when the US boldly sent two aircraft carrier groups to counter Chinese aggression near Taiwan. This showdown marked a turning point, signaling that China was no longer content with playing second fiddle.

QcIXdS_02Yo,Chongqing - Vida nocturna en la gran urbe china | DW Documental,"Crece sin cesar una ciudad que no es apta para personas con vértigo ni con estómago delicado. Quien quiera experimentar China no puede dejar de visitar la creciente megalópolis de Chongqing.

Chongqing, en el sudoeste de China, ha experimentado un crecimiento exponencial en las últimas tres décadas: 32 millones de personas viven en una región del tamaño de Austria. Chongqing es una de las ciudades más grandes del mundo en lo que a superficie se refiere y en China es toda una atracción turística. La ciudad es famosa por imágenes como la del tren que atraviesa el octavo piso de un rascacielos o la plaza ubicada a 20 pisos de altura. Los influencers han hecho famosa esta ciudad que, en el pasado, sirvió sobre todo de puerto de apoyo de cruceros turísticos.

Los vecinos de Chongqing tienen fama de ser especialmente acogedores, como el guía Zhen Jili, que conoce cada rincón de la ciudad y ha vivido de primera mano cómo su ""gran pueblo” se ha convertido en metrópoli. Muestra los distintos niveles de la urbe, en los que un GPS no es de gran ayuda.

El chofer Shen Xun conduce a los visitantes por la vida nocturna de Chongqing, que siempre se prolonga hasta la mañana siguiente. Como en China rige una estricta prohibición del alcohol al volante, quienes hayan bebido algo pueden recurrir a Shen Xun. Este acude con una bicicleta plegable, la mete en el maletero y lleva a casa a sus clientes y su auto.
En cada esquina se ven livestreamers como Paipai. Explica por qué es un negocio multimillonario en China y conduce a sus espectadores a uno de los edificios más altos de la ciudad, desde donde hay unas vistas de vértigo.

24 Hours in China:The WORST Travel Experience Ever! 🇨🇳 😤

China! The country I was more excited about than any other, but I obviously wasn't meant to be there, everything that could go wrong did, to the point where I thought my head was going to explode.

I arrived in Shanghai late, then customs had seized my bag, then my VPN did not work, I couldn't find a sim card, then it was problem after problem.

I realised that this is not the country for me and I bailed within 24 hours ... Will I come back? Maybe, but I like freedom, and this was just not it for me!

China is conducting a mega air show In the southern city of Zhuhai. A lot of aircraft, drones and naval equipment are on display. But the show has two top attractions. One is a stealth fighter jet - called the J-35A. It's being billed as Beijing's answer to America's F-35. The second top attraction is not even Chinese. It's a Russian SU-57 jet which is on display at this year's air show. But what is a Russian jet doing here? And what does China hope to achieve with this display of military might? Palki Sharma tells you.

*Synopsis | Sending a Message (2024)*
It might not be a conventional tactic, but military forces all around the world love to show off.  And it’s exactly what the United States and 28 of its allies, including Australia, is currently doing on and around the Hawaiian islands. RIMPAC 2024, as it’s called, is an extraordinary spectacular of the world’s most lethal weaponry. It’s loud, menacing and quite overwhelming. For this story, reporter Dimity Clancey and her team were granted extraordinary access to the operation, which included filming on board the massive USS Carl Vinson Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, as well as securing a rare interview with the US Chief of Naval Operations and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Lisa Franchetti. America and its partners view RIMPAC 2024 as the perfect opportunity to send a decisive message to any would-be adversaries: Mess with us at your peril.

dkkk-aqhcxo,China: Jugend unter Xi Jinping | ARTE Reportage,"Staats- und Parteichef Xi Jinping verspricht seit einigen Jahren „Wohlstand für alle“ und für China die „globale Führung“. Nun stagniert die Wirtschaft, die Immobilienpreise fallen ins Bodenlose und die Jugendarbeitslosigkeit lag zeitweise bei über 20 Prozent.

Xi Jinping aber lässt lieber die Statistiken zensieren und die Berichterstattung über die Krise unterdrücken. Die Jugend solle jetzt eben lernen, Bitterkeit zu ertragen, so wie der Staatschef selbst, der während der Kulturrevolution unter Mao gegen Ende der sechziger bis Anfang der siebziger Jahre auf dem Land schuften und hungern musste. 
Und was machen die jungen Leute, wenn sie nach einem teuren Studium an einer Eliteuni keinen Job finden? Manche praktizieren „tang ping“ (sich flach hinlegen) und „bai lan“ (es einfach laufen lassen) als eine stille Form des Protests gegen den ständigen Leistungsdruck und die Erwartungen der Gesellschaft. Viele junge Menschen ziehen sich aus der urbanen Leistungsgesellschaft zurück und suchen nach alternativen Lebenswegen auf dem Land oder als sogenannte „bezahlte Kinder“ bei ihren Eltern. 
Unser Reporter gewann das Vertrauen von drei jungen Leuten, dem 24-jährigen Uni-Absolventen Tianqing, der 30-jährigen Marketing-Managerin Qianqian und dem 28-jährigen Lieferfahrer Erchui. Die ersten beiden suchen schon länger verzweifelt nach einem neuen gut bezahlten Job und der dritte hofft auf bessere Zeiten, irgendwann…

Lixiangyang's Hulatang & Fried Dumpling (东新街李向阳糊辣汤) - We’re starting with a very popular Muslim breakfast stall that’s famous for dumpling buns - 4 RMB ($0.56) for 5, hulatang (hot and spicy soup) - 9 RMB ($1.26), and some of the best Chinese vegetable pockets - Price - 5 RMB ($0.70) that I’ve ever had. Breakfast was on another level! 

Three Brother's Vegetable Burger (玄风桥三兄弟菜夹馍) - Next up on this Chinese food tour today, Xi’an is famous for its Chinese burgers, often filled with meat, but this one is vegetarian and it’s so good. Price - 6 RMB ($0.86)

You can’t come to Xi’an without visiting the Xi'an City Wall. The wall has so much history and to this day the old part of the city is still surrounded by the wall.

Jing Gao - You’ll notice this unique sticky rice stick dessert all over Xi’an and it’s as tempting as it looks. The taste is actually quite nice as well, and very convenient to eat. Price - 3 RMB ($0.43) 

Shangzhai Big Bowl Noodle (南柳巷尚寨老碗面) - Easily one of the most famous of all Chinese noodles in Xi’an is Biang Biang Noodles (油泼扯面). This place is very popular, but I was a little disappointed that his place doesn’t actually hand pull their noodles, but instead slices them. That being said, they were incredibly delicious with the splashed hot chili oil on top. Price - 12 RMB ($1.71). Don’t worry, coming soon we’ll go to a place where they still hand pull their noodles. 

Wangkui's Burger (骡马市南口王魁肉夹馍) - Roujiamo (肉夹馍) is the famous Xi’an Chinese burger and this restaurant is legendary and one of the most famous. Price - 10 RMB ($1.43)

Chang'an Da Paidang (长安大排档上元灯会 葫芦鸡) - You can eat street food and noodles forever in Xi’an, but it’s also nice to sit down and eat some of the bigger main dishes of this region of Chinese food. Xi’an is famous for Gourd chicken (葫芦鸡), a whole fried chicken, and some other unique dishes. Price - 91 RMB ($12.98) total *I think they gave us a few complimentary dishes. 
 
Another outstanding day of delicious Chinese food in Xi’an, China!

CagL_npXT-Y,"Royal Navy Aircraft Carrier SURROUNDED by Chinese and Russian Ships, Then THIS Happened...","It was a tense and extraordinary moment in the Pacific Ocean. HMS Queen Elizabeth, the pride of the Royal Navy, suddenly found herself shadowed by a fleet of Chinese and Russian warships in contested waters. What happened next was both unexpected and could have had serious consequences for international relations. Today, we'll dive into that dramatic encounter and unravel its implications.
HMS Queen Elizabeth, the UK's flagship aircraft carrier, had been deployed to the Indo-Pacific as part of its ongoing mission to support freedom of navigation and demonstrate Britain’s unwavering commitment to its global allies. This deployment was crucial, especially with rising tensions in strategic regions like the South China Sea. The deployment was not only a show of force but also a strong message of support to Britain’s key allies, including the United States, Japan, and Australia. The mighty aircraft carrier was at the heart of a powerful Carrier Strike Group, equipped with state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning II fighter jets and an entire array of naval assets, such as destroyers, frigates, and supply ships. Together, these naval forces were conducting joint military exercises, emphasizing the UK's intent to play a pivotal role in maintaining peace and stability in one of the world's most strategically important areas.

XYj5bCHHPyc,EP #35 Visiting The Most Beautiful Village of China - Lijiang ചൈനയിലെ ഗ്രാമങ്ങൾ നമ്മളെ ഞെട്ടിക്കും,"EP #35 Visiting The Most Beautiful Village of China - Lijiang ചൈനയിലെ ഗ്രാമങ്ങൾ നമ്മളെ ഞെട്ടിക്കും #techtraveleat #china 

This time my trip was to the villages of China. Although Though I have been to China several times, I am seeing such beautiful villages there for the first time. A traditional Chinese video unlike anything you've ever seen before, with the village's beautiful farm fields, villagers, fishing, and the local market.

ചൈനയിലെ ഗ്രാമങ്ങളിലേക്കായിരുന്നു ഇത്തവണത്തെ എന്റെ യാത്ര. മുൻപ് പലതവണ ചൈനയിൽ വന്നിട്ടുണ്ടെങ്കിലും അവിടത്തെ മനോഹരമായ ഗ്രാമങ്ങൾ ആദ്യമായിട്ടാണ് ഞാൻ കാണുന്നത്. ഗ്രാമത്തിലെ മനോഹരമായ കൃഷിത്തോട്ടങ്ങളും സാധാരണക്കാരായ ഗ്രാമീണരും മീൻപിടുത്തവും അവിടത്തെ ലോക്കൽ ചന്തയുമൊക്കെയായി ഇതുവരെ വന്നതിൽ നിന്നും വ്യത്യസ്തമായ ഒരു നാടൻ ചൈനീസ് വീഡിയോ.

In 2023, I conducted an interview to understand how Taiwan's young generation perceives China. As we swiftly move into 2024 and elect a new president amidst constantly shifting international circumstances, I feel that as a Taiwanese person, documenting annual interviews with the youth in the form of a documentary could be a meaningful endeavor. After all, they are the future custodians of Taiwan! I hope this interview will also inspire you in new ways.

k98BH_o5DoU,Trump’s trade war with China: a win for the US or a global disaster?,"Can a trade war with China be won? President-elect Donald Trump has promised to put America first with tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese imports. But will the result be a stronger U.S. economy or a global economic crisis? Millions of Americans support Trump’s plan to “punish” China, yet doubts remain about whether this approach can truly bring jobs back to the U.S. With questions over Taiwan’s security, the shifting role of the Global South, and how consumers might respond to rising retail prices, we dive into the uncertain future of US-China relations.

👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/   

Lixiangyang's Hulatang & Fried Dumpling (东新街李向阳糊辣汤) - We’re starting with a very popular Muslim breakfast stall that’s famous for dumpling buns - 4 RMB ($0.56) for 5, hulatang (hot and spicy soup) - 9 RMB ($1.26), and some of the best Chinese vegetable pockets - Price - 5 RMB ($0.70) that I’ve ever had. Breakfast was on another level! 

Three Brother's Vegetable Burger (玄风桥三兄弟菜夹馍) - Next up on this Chinese food tour today, Xi’an is famous for its Chinese burgers, often filled with meat, but this one is vegetarian and it’s so good. Price - 6 RMB ($0.86)

You can’t come to Xi’an without visiting the Xi'an City Wall. The wall has so much history and to this day the old part of the city is still surrounded by the wall.

Jing Gao - You’ll notice this unique sticky rice stick dessert all over Xi’an and it’s as tempting as it looks. The taste is actually quite nice as well, and very convenient to eat. Price - 3 RMB ($0.43) 

Shangzhai Big Bowl Noodle (南柳巷尚寨老碗面) - Easily one of the most famous of all Chinese noodles in Xi’an is Biang Biang Noodles (油泼扯面). This place is very popular, but I was a little disappointed that his place doesn’t actually hand pull their noodles, but instead slices them. That being said, they were incredibly delicious with the splashed hot chili oil on top. Price - 12 RMB ($1.71). Don’t worry, coming soon we’ll go to a place where they still hand pull their noodles. 

Wangkui's Burger (骡马市南口王魁肉夹馍) - Roujiamo (肉夹馍) is the famous Xi’an Chinese burger and this restaurant is legendary and one of the most famous. Price - 10 RMB ($1.43)

Chang'an Da Paidang (长安大排档上元灯会 葫芦鸡) - You can eat street food and noodles forever in Xi’an, but it’s also nice to sit down and eat some of the bigger main dishes of this region of Chinese food. Xi’an is famous for Gourd chicken (葫芦鸡), a whole fried chicken, and some other unique dishes. Price - 91 RMB ($12.98) total *I think they gave us a few complimentary dishes. 
 
Another outstanding day of delicious Chinese food in Xi’an, China!

4Ek-VcMaEIU,How China Is Rewiring Its Faltering Economy,"Xi Jinping has a plan to fix his country’s faltering economy and offset the pain caused by the property crisis. The goal is to move up the value chain. Out with dirty, low-end manufacturing and in with new industries like solar and electric vehicles. The problem, however, is Chinese consumers aren’t spending. Also, Beijing faces a tense trade and geopolitical landscape with the US and Europe.

6Ij-oYHlhSI,Xi Warns Against 'Vicious Competition' Between US and China,"President Xi Jinping warned America’s top diplomat that the US shouldn’t target or oppose China, as the world’s largest economies wrapped two days of talks spanning thorny disputes on trade and Beijing’s support for Russia’s war machine.

The Chinese leader met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Beijing on Friday afternoon, as the two superpowers continued dialogue to manage a growing list of differences. While the substance of talks was confrontational, both sides refrained from the sharpest rhetoric. They also announced a new working group on artificial intelligence to start in the coming weeks, bolstering expectations for keeping ties steady.

“China and the United States should be partners rather than rivals,” Xi told Blinken, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. The two sides should “seek common ground and reserve differences, rather than engage in vicious competition,” he added.

President-elect Donald Trump has promised to put America first with tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese imports. But will the result be a stronger U.S. economy or a global economic crisis? Millions of Americans support Trump’s plan to “punish” China, yet doubts remain about whether this approach can truly bring jobs back to the U.S. With questions over Taiwan’s security, the shifting role of the Global South, and how consumers might respond to rising retail prices, we dive into the uncertain future of US-China relations.

GZOHXOzH7M8,"Ukraine, China, Russia: How are they Reacting to Trump's Win? | Vantage with Palki Sharma","Ukraine, China, Russia: How are they Reacting to Trump's Win? | Vantage with Palki Sharma

World leaders raced to congratulate Donald Trump as he triumphed in a stunning US election victory over Kamala Harris. European leaders in particular were quick to extend their best wishes and offers of cooperation, in contrast to a much cooler reaction when Trump won for the first time in 2016. There were some exceptions, such as Russia, where the foreign ministry frostily commented on the outcome. Palki Sharma tells you how the world reacted to Trump's win.

5i3Y14TNqCI,How China Uses Mexico To Avoid U.S. Tariffs,"For the first time in more than two decades Mexico overtook China as the largest importer of goods to the U.S.

Mexican goods imported to the U.S. totaled $475 billion in 2023 about $20 billion higher than the previous year. Feuling that trend are simmering trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, an effort to bring U.S. imports closer to home and a burgeoning Mexican manufacturing base. But there’s another factor at play. To avoid American tariffs Chinese companies are using Mexico as a backdoor to the U.S. So how is China able to circumvent U.S. tariffs and what are logistic companies doing to prepare for the upcoming boom in Mexican trade. CNBC traveled to Mexico City and El Paso to find out.

Rm_PinJ8E4U,"Trump Victory - What it means for Ukraine, Middle East, Russia, China and Europe | BBC News","Donald Trump’s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising uncertainty on many fronts.

Mr Trump has promised to end the war in Ukraine and reset trade relations, with America First policies of protectionism and tariffs.  

Policy in the Middle East, where Israel is fighting in Gaza and Lebanon with US military support, is uncertain. 

The new President has a combative relationship with China over trade, while military tensions have been growing over Taiwan. 

The European Union and NATO will again face Mr Trump’s longstanding demands that they do more to provide for their own military defence.

For the past few years, economics have been trying to convince China to rebalance its economy - but to no avail. However, recent comments by CCP officials suggest that Xi does indeed have a plan to fix the economy by redirecting investment away from property towards science. In this video, we're taking a look at what this means, and whether tech investment can really just be as unsustainable as property.

Our trip was to Urumqi, the Xinjiang region which has the largest Muslim population in China. I was a bit afraid to visit and explore that area because of the news we heard through the media. But what I experienced was the opposite of my thoughts. Watch to see the different outlook, people and food from China from what we have heard and seen so far.

yzl4jc9E5GU,"Magic of Chongqing, A Mind-blowing Walking Tour of China's Craziest City","This is my second time coming to this magical city, and I feel the breathtaking beauty and magic again.
-------------------⭐⭐
A Charming City of Antiquity and Modernity
-------------------⭐⭐
Chongqing, A.K.A Yu for short, is located along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Southwest China. As China’s fourth municipality directly under the administration of the Central Government and the only one in Western China, it is newly established as one of five central cities in China. 

Chongqing is one of China's four direct-controlled municipalities (the others are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin). 

It is the largest of the municipalities by area and it is the only one that is located far away from the coast. Chongqing is located in southwestern China within Sichuan Province and shares borders with Shaanxi, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces. 

The city is known as being an important economic center along the Yangtze River as well as a historical and cultural center for the country of China.

Chongqing covers 82,400 square kilometers and governs 38 districts and counties (including autonomous counties), and has a total population of 33,434,400 with 29,450,000 permanent residents. 

Chongqing is a great city to explore with its winding walkways, stairways and banyan besieged older neighbourhoods. Its locals are frank and honest and delightfully playful.

Chongqing is a humid city. Summer and autumn are the rainy seasons. The annual rainfall is 1,000-1,100mm.

Chongqing is a logistics hub combining water, road and air transportations, a modern manufacturing base, an important business center and the pivot for integrated transportation and communications along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and in southwest China. 

It has established business and trade relations with more than 180 countries and regions. Modern farming is now growing with strong momentum, as are a wide range of fast developing industries, including automobile, motorcycle, equipment, gas/petroleum chemical engineering and materials.

Chongqing is a well-known tourism city for its fantastic mountain-river scenery and abundant historic and cultural sites.

-------------------⭐⭐
Chongqing is famous for its delicious Sichuan style cuisine and hotpot.
-------------------⭐⭐
Due to a classification technicality, Chongqing municipality can claim to be the largest city proper in the world—though it does not have the world's largest urban area. Chongqing is the only city in China with a permanent population of over 30 million, however this number includes a large rural population.

Among them, the total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million. Shanghai is China's most populous urban area while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with the largest permanent population of over 30 million.

Most of travelers come to Chongqing are mainly for the relaxing 4 / 5 days Yangtze River cruise, but, the city itself, has many things to see and explore. If you like, you can spend another half day to two days visiting the mountain city and around.

The most important city in western China and the economic engine of the upper Yangzi, Chongqing City is a massive and enthralling urban sprawl. Chongqing makes up for a lack of top-notch sights with fantastic food and charismatic geography: its combination of steep hills at the confluence of the Yangzi and Jialing Rivers is a prelude to the even more dramatic scenery of the Three Gorges downstream.

-------------------⭐⭐

On March 14, 1997, however, the city was merged with the neighboring districts of Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang and it was separated from Sichuan to form Chongqing Municipality, one of China's four direct-controlled municipalities.

Today Chongqing is one of the most important economic centers in western China. It also has a diversified economy with major industries in processed food, automobile manufacturing, chemicals, textiles, machinery, and electronics. The city is also the largest area for the manufacture of motorcycles in China.

According to recent intelligence reports from South Korea and Ukraine, this significant military movement may impact not only the war in Ukraine but also global geopolitical dynamics. We explore why China, despite its alliance with Russia, might oppose North Korea’s involvement and how this could influence the balance of power in East Asia. From strained Sino-Russian ties to China's precarious economic position, discover the potential outcomes of North Korea’s military commitment to Russia and its implications for international stability. What will this mean for China, the West, and global peace?

I have been to several cities in China, and now it's time to go to rural China. So, what's rural China going to be like? People told me I might not have a good time in the Chinese countryside as people might be rude, won't speak any English and it might even be dangerous there for foreigners. I also heard a lot of negative things about Rural China from western media so I want to see it with my own eyes and find out the truth about rural China. Join us!

kmYdpHtOv_E,Is Xi Jinping’s China on a path to war? Mehdi Hasan & Victor Gao | Head to Head,"Over the past few decades, China has solidified its status as an economic superpower. But the country’s economic boom coupled with its increased military might has increased tensions in the region, including with Taiwan, where fears are mounting over a possible Chinese invasion.

Meanwhile, at home, China’s human rights record remains under the spotlight with severe curtailments on free speech and a continued hardline policy on the country’s Uighur community.

So what lies ahead?

Mehdi Hasan goes head-to-head with Victor Gao, the former translator for Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, on President Xi Jinping's rule, China's foreign policy and its clampdown on dissent.

Joining the discussion are:

Rayhan Asat – international human rights lawyer of Uighur descent and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council

Stephen Chan – professor of world politics at the University of London, School of African and Oriental Studies

Martin Jacques – author of When China Rules the World and visiting professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing

Right now the Chinese communist party and the United States are fighting a hidden spy war against one another. On the frontlines of this battle for China is their minsitry of state security also known as the MSS. This agency has a long history of brutal political purges and interrogation tactics. Right now the Chinese Communist party and the United States are fighting a hidden spy war against one another. And on the frontlines of this battle for China is their shadowy Ministry of State Security also known as the (MSS). It’s one of the world’s largest and most secret agency of all. For context they are said to have an estimated 110,000 agents compared to the CIA’s roughly 21,000. It’s like their version of the FBI and CIA all rolled up into one. They have both a domestic and a foreign mission under one roof. At least that’s how this partially redacted document from the US justice department described it.

But not many people in the west know about the history that informs their tactics today. Not many people know about some of the most brazen intelligence missions where they’ve targeted and killed dozens of CIA agents in their country including in brutal public executions. 

I find this agency interesting because they have such a different mode of operating compared than a lot of other nations. We’ll see how they use their power differently. Take for example Jack Ma  the billionaire Chinese founder of Alibaba. He disappeared from public view in 2020 after he made the mistake of publicly criticizing China's financial regulators. Then authorities halted the roughly $34 billion dollar IPO of his company Ant Group, which was going to be the worlds largest IPO in history at the time.

Ma missed high profile events which sparked widespread fears for his safety. 3 months later her resurfaced in a video saying he was okay. Jack Ma had learned his lesson, the MSS will come for you if you gain enough influence in China.

Peter Mattis and Matthew Brazil closely studied the MSS for many years and wrote a book called communist espionage that reveals many of the MSS secrets.  According to them 
""The language Chinese intelligence uses reflects its Marxist–Leninist and revolutionary heritage. The intelligence services are bastions of faith in the CCP. Although they may be practical in terms of techniques and methods to acquire intelligence, this information is filtered through a Marxist–Leninist lens. The implication is that foreign targets are viewed in the worst possible light.""
The way it works is the MSS has control of its own separate police force called the “state security police” which is a component of the people's police.

todays video is Shows Why  are China and Taiwan Fighting...
so the main reason is the Chinese Civil war, you see in 1945 the Republics of China or the ROC was exhausted by the 2nd world war, The Peoples republic of China or PRC exploited the situation and defeated the ROC in a prolonged and brutal civil war,
The ROC was compelled to withdraw from the mainland and seek refuge on the small island of Taiwan,
now in 2022 ROC still maintains its claims over all the regions that were once part of the old Qing Dynasty which also includes entire China,

International brands have enjoyed a mostly free run in the Chinese market since China opened its doors to foreign investors in the late 1970s. Starbucks, Apple and McDonald’s are among the major names to have dominated the Chinese market after introducing services and products that did not exist in the country. In recent years, however, the multinationals have struggled with falling profits in China. While a slumping domestic market is one reason for the decline, domestic Chinese brands, often with their own take on Western trends, have also steadily eaten away at market share. So does the change signal the end of an era for Western brands in China?

Then I am traveling along the Yalu River further north east towards the Russian border to visit North Koreas largest copper mine and the Koreans' most holy mountain: Chang Bai Shan  🗻

Join me on this exciting trip to the world's most mysterious country 🇰🇵🎬

rOAt6Xt9vlI,La China de Xi Jinping | DW Documental,"El presidente Xi Jinping quiere convertir a la República Popular China en la principal potencia mundial del futuro. El país jamás había sido tan poderoso ni había perseguido objetivos tan ambiciosos, ni había alterado de tal forma el equilibrio geopolítico mundial.

El principal responsable es el presidente de la República Popular, Xi Jinping. Como figura clave de la política china, dirige el país comunista desde 2013 con cálculo y pragmatismo. En el ámbito interno, Xi aspira a la ""dictadura perfecta"", mientras que en política exterior quiere reescribir las reglas de la política internacional.  ¿Cuáles son los objetivos de este misterioso autócrata, profundamente influenciado por el maoísmo en su juventud? ¿Cuáles son sus motivaciones? El documental repasa el ascenso del presidente chino y sus planes políticos para el futuro.

Su apariencia amistosa no debe llamar a engaño: Xi Jinping está dispuesto a hacer cualquier cosa para cumplir la misión de su Partido Comunista: convertir a China en la primera potencia económica y militar para 2049, cuando se cumpla el centenario de la República Popular. En 2017, Xi Jinping fue nombrado ""presidente vitalicio"" por la Asamblea Popular Nacional tras una profunda purga política. Su grito de guerra es el ""sueño chino"", una nueva ideología con tintes nacionalistas. Los que no siguen la línea dictada por el gobierno terminan en la cárcel y tienen que pedir disculpas públicamente. Además, un nuevo sistema de vigilancia electrónica distinguirá entre buenos y malos ciudadanos. En la escena internacional, Xi Jinping, bajo la apariencia de acuerdos supuestamente beneficiosos para ambas partes, intenta establecer un modelo social que resulta preocupante para las democracias occidentales. 

Este reportaje sobre el presidente Xi Jinping es único hasta ahora. Un coronel del Ejército Popular de Liberación, un historiador de Pekín, varios críticos del régimen, un exembajador de Estados Unidos en China y varios biógrafos tratan de descifrar la estrategia inflexible de este ""hombre fuerte"".

Xinjiang, Uyghur Autonomous Region - China's most controversial area

Urumqi, Xinjiang China - I traveled to the far west of China to visit the Uyghur Autonomous Region. This region is all over western media for not so good reasons. But as usual, I am curious to see things with my own eyes. So, i booked a flight to Urumqi, which is the capital of the Xinjiang province in west China. This is by the way also the biggest province in China. According to some comments on my channel, I would not even be allowed to enter, as the region is apparently closed for foreigners. Well, I was able to enter without any problems and soon after I found myself exploring the city center of Urumqi. It was freezing cold there though: Around -20 °C (-4 °F). Join me as we explore around to get to know this region of China, meet local Ughyur Muslims, try local food and see what Xinjiang, China is really like!

mUk7cNFWZRM,Dozens killed in China after car ploughs into crowd | BBC News,"At least 35 people have been killed and 43 more injured after a car ploughed into a crowd of people at a stadium in Zhuhai, China on Monday, according to authorities.
 
A 62-year-old male driver, surnamed Fan, is alleged to have driven an SUV through a barrier and into Zhuhai Sports Centre in what local police described as a ""serious and vicious attack"".
 
Chinese media reported that many elderly people, as well as teenagers and children, were among the injured.
 
Fan was arrested while trying to flee, police said, and is currently in a coma as a result of self-inflicted wounds.
 
The BBC’s China correspondent Stephen McDonnell reports from the scene, where locals appeared to attempt to keep journalists away.

The BBC was given rare access to the Jiuquan Satellite launch centre in Gansu and were just over a kilometre away when Shenzhou 19 blasted off.

The launch is also the latest success in the fast-paced development of China's space industry - and it is reportedly worrying some in the US.

But China has spent years courting other producers as it is relying more on Brazil and other Latin American countries. China is also exploring ways to become self-sufficient long-term through embracing new technology and better farming education.

WSJ explains why growing its own grains has been such a struggle for China and how it has been trying to wean itself off of its reliance on U.S. corn production.

This is a landmark moment as we bring you the very first visit to Kaho, India’s first village. This is the very first time a digital platform has reached the ‘start of India,’ where the country begins, and the adventure never stops.

Experience the stunning landscapes, majestic mountains, and awe-inspiring views of this remote region. During our time in Kibithu, I had the honor of learning vital self-defense techniques and martial arts, emphasizing the importance of women's safety.

Additionally, we handed over heartfelt letters from families to our brave soldiers, written on eco-friendly  @jkpaperindia5578   —made sustainably without cutting down trees, supporting local farmers and protecting our environment. Don’t miss this adventure where beauty, culture, and community come together!

Now, It’s Back. | WSJ Then vs. Now","The U.S. was flooded with cheap Chinese-made goods that helped keep inflation low in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Manufacturing jobs declined by 5.7 million from 2000 to today, in what economists call “China Shock.” Now, those imports from China are surging again in industries like EVs, semiconductors and renewable energy.

WSJ looks at what’s different this time around – and what that means for American jobs and the U.S. economy.

RTYZTWLifKQ,"China removes social media references to deadly Zhuhai car ramming incident killing 35, injuring 43","On Monday evening, a tragic car-ramming incident in China’s Zhuhai city resulted in numerous fatalities, with details emerging only 24 hours later. Residents expressed their condolences by leaving flowers and lighting candles at a stadium, though authorities swiftly removed these tributes. Social media images showed many casualties, but government censors quickly deleted these clips. The 62-year-old perpetrator, allegedly driven by anger over a divorce settlement, was arrested at the scene with self-inflicted wounds. The incident evoked memories of a recent stabbing of a Japanese schoolboy in Shenzhen, which similarly garnered public sympathy and opposition to violence.

Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride reports from Beijing.

N6PRZH-0TCA,"China implements plan to seize Russia without war, Xi started game that Putin has no idea about","#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine
https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!
Military expert, retired colonel of Ukrainian Army Oleh Zhdanov, suggested that the Chinese authorities may well implement a plan to seize the Russian Federation without war.

As an option, the military expert is considering the version that instead of North Korean soldiers, Chinese special forces are being sent to Russia, of which another 15,000 should arrive there by the end of the year.

The military expert voiced his version of the provision of North Korean troops to Putin: ""I think that this is most likely a multi-move by China to 'put' Russia on an 'unremovable hook' so that it cannot 'break loose', cannot 'jump off'. China 'gives the go-ahead' to North Korea. It may supply part of its ammunition, which North Korea sends to the Russian Federation. Today, the Russian Federation is 60% dependent on North Korea in terms of ammunition.""

""Also, it provides troops and for quite a long time, since 2019, presumably, the military has been coming. And how can you tell a Chinese special forces soldier from a North Korean? An interesting question, right? Both the language and appearance are similar. If we assume that China is providing its special forces, then they are already in the Kursk region, and Kursk is a stone's throw from Moscow,"" Oleh Zhdanov added. At the same time, the colonel emphasized: ""Prigozhin covered 800 km from Rostov in half a day or a little more, and here from Kursk to Moscow, it is very close. By the way, by the end of this year, 15,000 soldiers should enter the territory of the Russian Federation, at four training grounds. And the Far East itself has long been assimilated by the Chinese, a long time ago. Newspapers are in Chinese, television is Chinese.""

Yet China is likely unsettled by this new phase of Moscow's fast-growing alliance with Pyongyang, which since last September has shipped thousands of containers believed to contain munitions and other matériel to help replenish Russian forces' stocks.

Beijing has presented itself as a neutral party regarding the war while at the same time censoring anti-war comments on Chinese social media and providing dual-use goods to Russia, its heavily sanctioned partner. China is also a critical economic lifeline because of discounted sales of Russian natural gas and oil.

China also wields considerable influence over Kim Jong Un's regime, having for decades propped up its state-controlled economy to prevent a regime collapse that could drive millions of North Korean refugees across the Chinese border.

Intercity rides from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng became a sensation when college students posted videos of their rides on Chinese social media.

YtjNHNudnjE,The moment BBC China reporter is pushed away from filming at car attack scene | BBC News,"At least 35 people have been killed in a car attack in southern China, believed to be the deadliest known act of public violence in the country in decades.
 
Police say a man crashed his car into a stadium in Zhuhai on Monday where he ran down groups of people exercising on a sports track. At least 45 people - among them elderly people and children - were reportedly injured.
 
While reporting about the attack, BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell was angrily ordered to stop filming.
 
It is not clear who the man who tried to stop the reporting was, though when sensitive stories like this unfold in China, local Communist Party officials organise groups of cadres to pretend to be outraged locals who have been given the role of targeting foreign reporters so as to prevent any coverage.

N6PRZH-0TCA,"China implements plan to seize Russia without war, Xi started game that Putin has no idea about","#Kanal13​ #likekanal13​ #subscribekanal13 #warinukraine
https://www.youtube.com/user/kanal13az?sub_confirmation=1 - SUBSCRIBE TO US!
Military expert, retired colonel of Ukrainian Army Oleh Zhdanov, suggested that the Chinese authorities may well implement a plan to seize the Russian Federation without war.

As an option, the military expert is considering the version that instead of North Korean soldiers, Chinese special forces are being sent to Russia, of which another 15,000 should arrive there by the end of the year.

The military expert voiced his version of the provision of North Korean troops to Putin: ""I think that this is most likely a multi-move by China to 'put' Russia on an 'unremovable hook' so that it cannot 'break loose', cannot 'jump off'. China 'gives the go-ahead' to North Korea. It may supply part of its ammunition, which North Korea sends to the Russian Federation. Today, the Russian Federation is 60% dependent on North Korea in terms of ammunition.""

""Also, it provides troops and for quite a long time, since 2019, presumably, the military has been coming. And how can you tell a Chinese special forces soldier from a North Korean? An interesting question, right? Both the language and appearance are similar. If we assume that China is providing its special forces, then they are already in the Kursk region, and Kursk is a stone's throw from Moscow,"" Oleh Zhdanov added. At the same time, the colonel emphasized: ""Prigozhin covered 800 km from Rostov in half a day or a little more, and here from Kursk to Moscow, it is very close. By the way, by the end of this year, 15,000 soldiers should enter the territory of the Russian Federation, at four training grounds. And the Far East itself has long been assimilated by the Chinese, a long time ago. Newspapers are in Chinese, television is Chinese.""

Yet China is likely unsettled by this new phase of Moscow's fast-growing alliance with Pyongyang, which since last September has shipped thousands of containers believed to contain munitions and other matériel to help replenish Russian forces' stocks.

Beijing has presented itself as a neutral party regarding the war while at the same time censoring anti-war comments on Chinese social media and providing dual-use goods to Russia, its heavily sanctioned partner. China is also a critical economic lifeline because of discounted sales of Russian natural gas and oil.

China also wields considerable influence over Kim Jong Un's regime, having for decades propped up its state-controlled economy to prevent a regime collapse that could drive millions of North Korean refugees across the Chinese border.

J5uY3JM-SLc,Inside The Army's $16 Million War Games Built To Battle China | Boot Camp | Business Insider,"As tension builds in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States Army trains warfighters to be ready for combat in the event of a military conflict with China.

After producing a documentary about the US Army's Jungle Operations Training Course on Oahu, Business Insider's chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan returned to Hawaii to embed with the Army's 25th Infantry Division in November 2023 for a two-week training exercise with over 5,000 participants, including members of foreign militaries like the Royal Thai Army and the New Zealand Defence Force.

The event, known as JPMRC, or Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center, pits the Army's 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, known as the Bronco Brigade or Bluefor, against an opposing force, Opfor, played by another brigade of Army soldiers in a sprawling war-games exercise held across the Hawaiian islands.

Flanagan follows Bluefor's Charlie Company as it braces for battle with Opfor on the desolate, lava-rock-laden Pohakuloa Training Area on the island of Hawaii. Charlie Company's ranking noncommissioned officer is 1st Sgt. Stewart Fletcher is an eccentric and seasoned combat veteran who now leads a new generation of soldiers who have yet to experience the reality of war.

With tensions rising, China is eyeing disputed territories, including Outer Manchuria and strategic islands. This rivalry stems back centuries to Russia’s imperial land grabs in the 19th century. Meanwhile, China’s Belt and Road Initiative and reliance on natural resources place it in a precarious position. The U.S., sanctions, and resource demands are shifting this ""limitless alliance.""

Read more about this story: https://sc.mp/7cea7c

More travellers are visiting an unusual destination – Afghanistan. Since 2021, the war-torn nation has seen tourism rise more than 900 per cent. Some attribute the change to official data reporting a sharp drop in violence and increased flight connections from major cities like Dubai. Most foreign visitors are from China, reportedly because of proximity and relative ease of obtaining tourist visas. The tourism buzz has undoubtedly brought economic benefits, but others worry the nation’s efforts to draw visitors amount to propaganda hiding the dark side of Taliban rule.

QjxE0WRJJdU,China’s Brand New Submarine Sank,"China’s newest nuclear attack submarine sank and Chinese authorities reportedly scrambled to cover it up. The US doesn’t know if it was carrying nuclear fuel but experts say that it likely was. They also say it’s likely that Chinese personnel died in the sub when it sank. China is rapidly building up its navy but if the subs are sinking fresh off the assembly line, that’s gonna delay things. Experts say this is huge and could completely derail Chinese naval production. With one saying “Can you imagine a U.S. nuclear submarine sinking in San Diego and the government hushes it up and doesn’t tell anybody about it? I mean, Holy Cow!” China’s goal is to achieve maritime superiority within the first island chain. The last time another country had naval superiority over it was Japan for like 2 years.

TP8QEsX9Xuw,China’s New Patent Shocks ASML… What’s Happening?!,"Huawei's recent patent filing for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology sends shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, causing ASML's stock to drop 8%. The patent covers crucial laser-produced plasma technology for chip manufacturing, potentially breaking ASML's monopoly on EUV machines. This development marks a significant step in China's push for semiconductor independence, challenging U.S. export restrictions. While technical hurdles remain, including the need for precise optics and high-powered lasers, Huawei's advancement could reshape the global chip industry, where China aims to increase its market share to 24% by 2030.

eDi4uf25hfo,China Is Outspending the U.S. to Achieve the ‘Holy Grail’ of Clean Energy | WSJ U.S. vs. China,"The U.S. and China are in a high-tech race to achieve and commercialize an elusive clean energy source: nuclear fusion. Fusion has the potential to create nearly limitless energy with no carbon emissions and very limited radioactivity. If China wins, it would have a leg up in a growing competition over energy resources as the U.S. is trying to shift more supply chains within domestic borders. 

WSJ explores what’s at stake as the competition over energy resources intensifies around the world.

Sabina Shoal, an atoll in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea has become a major flashpoint between China and the Philippines. Warships from the two countries have collided with each other over the Sabina Shoal at least 8 times this year. Most recently, a Chinese coast guard ship rammed into the Philippine ship Magbanua thrice. Beijing has accused Manila of violating its sovereignty, despite Sabina Shoal being a Filipino Island. Additionally, China uses its Subi Reef, Mischief Reef and Fiery Cross Reef to deploy warships near the Second Thomas Shoal, Sabina Shoal and Taiwan’s Taiping Island. After the recent incidents, the United States has pledged to deploy its warships in the region which would patrol alongside their Filipino counterparts. Japan too has accused China of aggression, after a Chinese Reconnaissance Y-8 aircraft entered Japanese airspace for the first time ever.

This time my trip was to the villages of China. Although Though I have been to China several times, I am seeing such beautiful villages there for the first time. A traditional Chinese video unlike anything you've ever seen before, with the village's beautiful farm fields, villagers, fishing, and the local market.

ചൈനയിലെ ഗ്രാമങ്ങളിലേക്കായിരുന്നു ഇത്തവണത്തെ എന്റെ യാത്ര. മുൻപ് പലതവണ ചൈനയിൽ വന്നിട്ടുണ്ടെങ്കിലും അവിടത്തെ മനോഹരമായ ഗ്രാമങ്ങൾ ആദ്യമായിട്ടാണ് ഞാൻ കാണുന്നത്. ഗ്രാമത്തിലെ മനോഹരമായ കൃഷിത്തോട്ടങ്ങളും സാധാരണക്കാരായ ഗ്രാമീണരും മീൻപിടുത്തവും അവിടത്തെ ലോക്കൽ ചന്തയുമൊക്കെയായി ഇതുവരെ വന്നതിൽ നിന്നും വ്യത്യസ്തമായ ഒരു നാടൻ ചൈനീസ് വീഡിയോ.

A China e os EUA estão prestes a iniciar a Terceira Guerra Mundial?

No episódio 103 do Market Makers, recebemos @ProfessorHOC (cientista político, professor e palestrante). Ele já trabalhou no Conselho de Segurança da ONU e foi deputado estadual por São Paulo. Formou-se em Filosofia e Ciências Políticas nos Estados Unidos e é mestre em Resolução de Conflitos e Paz Internacional pela American University, em Washington DC. Professor de Relações Internacionais, HOC tem popularizado o conhecimento sobre geopolítica por meio de seu canal PROFESSOR HOC no YouTube, que é o maior canal de geopolítica do Brasil, com mais de 1 milhão e 300 mil inscritos.

Mergulhamos nas tensões crescentes entre China e EUA e o risco de uma Terceira Guerra Mundial. Analisamos como a diferença de poder entre essas duas potências está se tornando insustentável, com ambos os lados se preparando para um confronto inevitável caso nenhuma das nações colapse. 

Discutimos também, como a lógica de poder pode levar a sacrifícios econômicos gigantescos, e como o desejo de manter ou mudar o status quo pode precipitar um conflito global. 

Você acredita que um confronto entre China e EUA é inevitável ou essas potenciais mundiais tem muito a perder e evitaram esse conflito.

BQ23sgi_mgw,Is China’s High-Tech ‘Overproduction’ Killing Jobs In The West? | When Titans Clash | Full Episode,"Some EU and US leaders have accused China of overcapacity, and dumping electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries on the global market, at artificially low prices. The fear is that this will lead US & EU companies to go bust. China has hit back, saying that there is no overcapacity in its 3 clean tech industries, and accusing some of these countries of being protectionist.

Who is right? Are we about to see a trade war erupt between EU and China, similar to what we had seen between the US and China?

ZDF-Korrespondentin Miriam Steimer berichtet aus Shanghai über den gesellschaftlichen Wandel in China.

aF_p1omXeok,Surviving 24 Hours in China's 3rd Class Over -Night Train,"I arrived at Chongqing Railway Station and went through the usual security checks. The station was incredibly luxurious, and I couldn't help but be amazed by how well it was maintained. After some confusion with my ticket, I finally managed to find my seat and settled in for a meal. Later, I took a stroll around the train, exploring its compartments, and even witnessed a small fight between passengers.

When I reached Lanzhou, I had to head over to Lanzhou West Railway Station for my next connection. After another round of security checks, I grabbed a coffee while waiting for my train. Once on board, I spent some time chatting with other passengers before taking a quick nap.

Soon, I arrived at Xining, where I had to catch yet another train to my final destination. It took a bit of effort to find the right train, but I eventually got on, though I couldn't find a seat. Since it was a short trip, it didn’t bother me much. Finally, I reached Zhangye.

Stay tuned for the next episode, where I’ll share more of my journey!

""Nusantara"" lies 1,400 kilometers northeast of Jakarta, which is sinking under the effects of climate change and policies related to overpopulation. It’s not the only reason countries around the world are watching Indonesia, which connects the Indian and Pacific Oceans. As Southeast Asia's most populated country, with 280 million residents, Indonesia is also the world's third largest democracy. Outgoing President Joko Widodo has focused on bringing an economic transformation to his country that his successor Prabowo Subianto has vowed to carry on. Why are both China and the U.S. investing billions into the country, and why does Indonesia hold the balance of power in Asia?

qY9Ah4jSBho,"Buat Kagum, Prabowo Berbahasa China di Forum Pebisnis Indonesia-Tiongkok! Tamu Tepuk Tangan","Download aplikasi berita TribunX di Play Store atau App Store untuk dapatkan pengalaman baru

TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Ada momen menarik saat Presiden Prabowo Subianto menghadiri acara Indonesia-China Bussiness Forum 2024 di Beijing, China pada Minggu (10/11/2024).

Kepala negara mendadak berbicara menggunakan bahasa China dan langsung disambut meriah para tamu undangan.

Presiden Prabowo mulanya mengungkapkan prinsipnya di hadapan para pebisnis Indonesia dan China.

Ia lantas menyebut pepatah 'seribu kawan terlalu sedikit, satu lawan terlalu banyak'.

Menariknya, kepala negara mengucapkan pepatah tersebut tak hanya menggunakan bahasa Inggris tetapi juga bahasa China.

Dikatakannya, ia banyak belajar dari para filsuf China dan memegang prinsip yang diajarkan oleh salah satu filsuf Tiongkok.

Yaitu perbanyak teman dan jangan ada musuh.

“Salah satu prinsip panduan saya yang kuat adalah seribu teman terlalu sedikit, satu musuh terlampau banyak, y?qi?n gè péngy?u tài sh?o, y?gè dírén tài du?,” ujar Prabowo dalam Bahasa Inggris, kemudian diikuti Bahasa Mandarin.

Para peserta forum yang hadir pun bertepuk tangan saat mendengar Prabowo berbahasa China.

Adapun Prabowo baru saja menjadi saksi penandatanganan kerja sama antara perusahaan Indonesia dan Tiongkok. 

Acara ini digelar oleh Kamar Dagang dan Industri (Kadin) Indonesia Komite Tiongkok (KIKT).

Presiden pun menekankan komitmen Indonesia untuk membangun kerja sama yang kuat dengan Tiongkok dalam berbagai bidang.

“Kami ingin terus bekerja sama dan bersinergi dengan China yang kembali menempati posisi penting di dunia. Kami ingin menjadi bagian dari kebangkitan ini. Kami memandang China sebagai kekuatan besar tidak hanya secara ekonomi, tetapi juga sebagai pusat kekuatan peradaban,” ucap Presiden Prabowo.

YtjNHNudnjE,The moment BBC China reporter is pushed away from filming at car attack scene | BBC News,"At least 35 people have been killed in a car attack in southern China, believed to be the deadliest known act of public violence in the country in decades.
 
Police say a man crashed his car into a stadium in Zhuhai on Monday where he ran down groups of people exercising on a sports track. At least 45 people - among them elderly people and children - were reportedly injured.
 
While reporting about the attack, BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell was angrily ordered to stop filming.
 
It is not clear who the man who tried to stop the reporting was, though when sensitive stories like this unfold in China, local Communist Party officials organise groups of cadres to pretend to be outraged locals who have been given the role of targeting foreign reporters so as to prevent any coverage.

8D2UpWNkRqQ,"Chinese Fighter Jets INTERCEPT US Navy Patrol in South China Sea, Then THIS Happened...","Tensions between the United States and China have reached unprecedented levels, particularly in the South China Sea. US Navy patrols navigating these contested waters often find themselves in close encounters with Chinese military aircraft—encounters that are far from routine. These high-stakes intercepts carry significant risks, not just for the pilots involved, but for regional stability and global peace. So, what really happens when a Chinese fighter jet intercepts a US Navy patrol? Could these encounters trigger a full-blown conflict? 
Let's jump straight into the action. The skies over the South China Sea have witnessed a growing number of close encounters between US and Chinese military aircraft, each one a potential flashpoint in this tense region.
One particularly alarming incident occurred in February 2023. A Chinese J-11 fighter jet closed to within 20 feet of a US Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft. The US plane was forced to fly through the wake turbulence of the Chinese jet, a maneuver that US officials described as ""unnecessarily aggressive"" and extremely dangerous.
And this wasn’t an isolated case. Just two months earlier, in December 2022, another J-11 fighter flew within 20 feet of a US RC-135’s nose, forcing it to take evasive maneuvers. The close proximity of these encounters shows just how easily a miscalculation could lead to disaster.

Setibanya di Bandara Internasional Beijing Capital, Prabowo mendapat sambutan spesial.

Bahkan Presiden Prabowo dikejutkan aksi seorang anak perempuan yang memberikannya buket bunga.

Kehadiran Prabowo ke China merupakan lawatan luar negeri pertama usai dilantik sebagai Presiden.

Sekretaris Kabinet Teddy Indra Wijaya menjadi garda terdepan dalam pengawalan presiden di China. Sempat terekam momen Teddy dengan wajah galak mengusir tangan seorang Paspampres China.

Pengusiran itu dilakukan karena anggota Paspampres China itu meletakan tangan di atas pintu mobil kepresidenan Prabowo. (felly/eko)

I quit my job because I didn’t like it, and now I can go traveling whenever I want. I have loads of time to focus on my interests and hobbies, which a lot of my married friends envy. But here I am, already 34. Most of my friends around my age already have kids in their teens.

Immer mehr junge Chinesinnen lehnen Ehe und Mutterschaft ab, fordern Gleichberechtigung und Unabhängigkeit. Gleichzeitig suchen Eltern auf ""Heiratsmärkten"" Partner für ihre Kinder. Die Kommunistische Partei sieht Feministinnen als Bedrohung, in der Politik bleiben Frauen unterrepräsentiert. ZDF-Korrespondentin Miriam Steimer berichtet aus Shanghai über den gesellschaftlichen Wandel in China.

eCjGU5TUC30,Why is China hiding 700 billion dollars?,"China runs large trade surpluses with the United States.  Typically these funds would be returned to the US as capital investments, either through buys of fixed assets, securities, or lending.

China, however, is liquidating stakes in companies in the United States, and is selling off its portfolio of Treasury bonds.

These two trends are resulting in enormous imbalances in Balance of Payments, which much be re-balanced via China's central banking activities.  China is clearly recycling giant capital pools from the United States for investment purposes inside China, and among China's top trading partners.  

And because the US dollars are never returned to the capital markets, it is also clear that China and the BRICS countries are setting up their own trading and economic bloc, funded largely with US debt instruments.

(Editor note:  At about the 2:00 mark, I misspoke.  The US ran a trade deficit of approximately $800 billion, not surplus.  Apologies.)

uuSgy8KkpTg,China 6th Generation Fighter Jet White Emperor Emerg at Zhuhai Airshow,"In this video, we analyze the recent footage showcasing what appears to be a sixth-generation fighter jet mockup from China, revealed just before the highly anticipated 2024 Zhuhai Airshow. This mockup hints at China’s latest advancements in stealth, AI integration, and potential roles in next-generation air dominance.

The prototype shown in the video has a distinctive tailless, streamlined design, which experts believe could enhance stealth capabilities by minimizing radar cross-section. This structural approach aligns with similar developments by the United States in its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, underscoring a growing trend toward stealthier, harder-to-detect fighter jets. Such advancements are part of a broader goal: creating aircraft that can evade detection from advanced radar systems, giving a significant advantage in both offensive and defensive aerial operations.

Beyond stealth, China’s sixth-generation ambitions appear to include advanced AI and network integration. This mockup represents what could eventually become a central node in a networked combat system, connecting with drones, electronic warfare platforms, and possibly hypersonic and directed-energy weapons. The potential inclusion of artificial intelligence would provide real-time battlefield analysis, enhancing situational awareness and enabling faster decision-making capabilities in high-pressure combat scenarios.

This latest unveiling also suggests that China is actively narrowing the technological gap with global leaders like the United States. While the prototype displayed is only a mockup, its appearance at the Zhuhai Airshow highlights China's commitment to advancing its air combat capabilities, potentially aiming for an operational model by 2035. This timeline coincides with the projected deployment of similar systems by the U.S., indicating a competitive timeline in the race for sixth-generation technology.

Historically, the Zhuhai Airshow has been a platform for showcasing China's defense innovations, often revealing prototypes or designs aimed at establishing China as a global leader in military technology. This sixth-generation fighter mockup serves as the latest example, attracting attention from defense analysts worldwide and fueling discussions on China's evolving aerial warfare strategy.

The video provides insights into what this development could mean for future military technology, the balance of air power, and the strategic significance of integrated defense systems. With AI, stealth, and advanced weapons integration at the core of these systems, this mockup hints at a future where next-generation fighter jets operate as both independent assets and networked components within larger combat ecosystems. As the Zhuhai Airshow unfolds, additional announcements could shed further light on China’s ambitions and the potential impact on global military dynamics.

Chinese and Russian nuclear-capable bombers have been spotted patrolling near Alaska.

President Joe Biden gives his fourth Oval Office address and explains why he's stepping aside for the 2024 race. We take a look at his administration's China policy.

The Justice Department charges a Florida man born in China with spying on Chinese dissidents in the United States. Authorities say he's been providing information to China's intelligence agency for more than a decade.

We take a deep dive into the world of illicit fentanyl and what it takes to produce the deadly synthetic opioids from scratch. The substance could be a lot more accessible than many think.

Hfq5hdetPgQ,"Nationwide Bankruptcy in China: Firefighters, Military, Police, Doctors Now Paid Just $250 Monthly","It’s unbelievable that firefighters’ salaries are being cut! Of all jobs, firefighters should be the last to face a pay cut. I recently spoke to a retired friend who became a full-time firefighter, and he told me his salary was reduced by over 2,000 yuan—almost half his income! He just got married, and now he’s worried about providing for his family. Firefighters, whether on the front lines or in monitoring roles, are true heroes, essential in times of peace. Their work is incredibly tough and risky. For anyone who doesn’t understand their sacrifices, just watch the movie *The Bravest*—I guarantee it will bring you to tears. Cutting their salaries just doesn’t make sense to me

Please speak to a professional before making any investment decisions. While I take great care in researching everything discussed in my videos, I do not guarantee that all claims are 100% accurate, all claims should be verified by viewers.

Notes on Sponsorships: 
China Update includes sponsored features from time to time. This is restricted to just 2 – 4 times per month to cover channel costs. When a sponsored feature is played it will be clearly marked at the beginning of the video and during the sponsored feature itself. These segments are sponsored, and should not be viewed the same way as the regular content on China developments.

In terms of sponsored products for consumer use, I will only work with products which I myself use and would recommend. It is also a common industry practice for companies doing financing to seek exposure. China Update is happy to provide this exposure for financial assets through sponsored content, and viewers can decide for themselves in consultation with investment professionals, whether these assets are a good fit for their investment portfolio. However, there are several conditions that need to be met before I will accept a sponsorship for a financial asset. 1) The financial asset must be traded in a major capital market; 2) It must be a established asset class (Stocks, not crypto); 3) It must not appear to be a scam; and 4) It must be an asset that I would consider adding to my own personal investment portfolio.",2024-07-22T12:30:35Z,UCy287hC44mRWpFLj4hK8gKA,China Update,[],25,,PT16M56S,57197,4056,0,440

Com novos atores entrando no campo de batalha, a dinâmica do conflito está mudando de maneiras inesperadas. Exploramos os desafios que a Rússia enfrenta para integrar as tropas norte-coreanas, as complexidades que surgem devido às barreiras de comunicação e as reações surpreendentes da China, que se encontra em uma situação geopolítica delicada. Será que essa nova aliança entre Rússia e Coreia do Norte pode desequilibrar o poder na Ásia? Que papel a China desempenhará à medida que as tensões aumentam? E como países como Coreia do Sul, Japão e até mesmo os Estados Unidos podem reagir a essa situação em escalada? Junte-se a nós enquanto analisamos esses desenvolvimentos críticos e discutimos o futuro potencial das relações globais.

JxcBWF1-lOM,🇨🇳 চায়নার কাচের ব্রিজ | Glass bridge in china | Bengali solo travel vlog | China Ep - 10,"🌏 Zhangjiajie National Park Glass Bridge Experience!** 🌏

Join me on an incredible journey as I embark on a solo adventure from the bustling streets of Kolkata to the awe-inspiring Zhangjiajie National Park in China. This travel video captures the stunning beauty and heart-pounding excitement of my visit to the world's longest glass bridge. Walking across the famous Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge was both terrifying and thrilling, and I can't wait to share every breathtaking moment with you!

From the moment I arrived in China, I was captivated by its spectacular sights and sounds. The Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon, with its towering cliffs and lush greenery, felt like stepping into a dream. But the highlight of my trip was undoubtedly the glass bridge China tour. 🌉 Suspended high above the canyon floor, this transparent bridge offered exhilarating views and an adrenaline rush like no other. There was even a fun glass bridge China accident prank that added an extra twist to the adventure!

Throughout my journey, I immersed myself in the local culture and explored the mesmerizing beauty of Zhangjiajie China. As a Bengali solo traveller, I faced unique challenges and incredible rewards, which I share in this video. From navigating visa information to finding the best travel routes, I provide detailed tour information and tips for fellow adventurers.

This video is more than just a travel vlog; it's a testament to the power of solo travel and the incredible experiences that await those who dare to explore. 🌏✈️ Whether you're planning your own international tour or simply dreaming of new destinations, I hope my story inspires you.

Don't miss out on the excitement—watch the full video and join me on this unforgettable adventure. Your support means the world to me, so please like, comment, and subscribe to stay updated on all my travels! ❤️👍

What Really Happened?,"Lithuania's bold decision to support Taiwan by allowing a representative office in Vilnius triggered severe economic retaliation from China, resulting in a 90% drop in exports. After three years of economic strain, Lithuanian leaders are now seeking to repair relations with Beijing. This shift reflects the complex challenge small nations face in balancing democratic principles with economic survival, as Lithuania grapples with domestic pressure and limited international support while attempting to normalize ties with China.

bHiAH7fBc8c,US Bill Could End China's Special Trade Status; Trump's Unexpected Defense Secretary Pick,"A new House bill would strip away the Chinese Communist Party's preferred trade status. The new tariffs would go toward supporting U.S. farmers and manufacturers.

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. defense chief is catching Washington off guard. What do we know about Pete Hegseth, the man set to deal with Beijing’s military if a conflict ever broke out?

Several Taiwanese advertisements are facing interference in Peru. Local media reports suggest the incidents are linked to the Chinese Communist Party leader's visit to its capital city.

A man who survived China’s forced organ removal says he fears for his life—even on U.S. soil.

9DgYFc8EO34,China Airshow Is A Joke: H-6K Bomber Displayed with U-Lock on Cockpit Door,"On November 6, 2024, at the airshow in Zhuhai, Guangdong, a H-6K bomber had a surprising detail: a large U-lock on its cabin door!
As China's only active ""strategic bomber,"" the H-6K is known for its ""strategic deterrence"" role and regularly appears in military exercises and airshows. This sight, with a simple U-lock on the door, led to widespread online mockery, with people questioning whether the cabin lock was really that unreliable, suggesting it could be easily opened by “hostile forces” to reveal “advanced technology.”

DBpeJXUETqk,China Becomes the Biggest Loser in Russia-North Korea Cooperation,"The deal between Kim Jong-un and Putin seems mutually beneficial on the surface. Kim is short on cash, food, and oil, while Putin, squeezed by Western sanctions, lacks weapons, soldiers, and funds, especially as the war in Ukraine drags on with no end in sight. Kim stepped in as an unexpected lifeline, offering soldiers, weapons, and ammunition. According to a recent report from South Korea’s National Intelligence Service to parliament, Russia is expected to pay each North Korean soldier about $2,000 monthly, though this money will almost certainly go to Pyongyang rather than the soldiers themselves. With around 10,000 soldiers deployed, Pyongyang stands to gain over $200 million annually. Russia will also provide North Korea with between 600,000 and 700,000 tons of rice annually, nearly 20% of North Korea’s total food production. This will help with North Korea’s roughly one million-ton food shortage each year.

RQ3YjZAzqxA,China's companies dominate in fast-growth economies across Global South and BRICS; US firms absent,"By 2030, more than 1.2 billion people will join the consumer class.  Over 95% of that growth will come in countries outside North America and Europe.

The growth in the emerging economies across the ""Global South"", and in the BRICS group of nations, is shocking in comparison to dormant European countries.  India, for example, will add over 400 million consumers by 2030, the equivalent to FIVE Germany's.

Chinese companies are already enjoying outsized gains, and see success immediately upon entering new markets.  BYD, a Chinese automaker, is seeing even TRIPLE-digit sales growth in some key markets.  In 2024, BYD has sold nearly 10 times as many cars in Thailand, and 30 times as many vehicles in Brazil, compared to Germany.

Some of that difference can be explained by high tariffs and shipping costs to Europe. But far more important have been the diplomatic, educational, and cultural partnerships across the over one hundred countries that comprise the Global South, and the commitment of Chinese companies to develop strong commercial ties there.  

To reach the 2 billion new consumers who will be created in the next ten years, American and European brands will need to reinvent themselves, and invest heavily in these markets where China has deep advantages.
